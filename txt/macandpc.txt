How to move files between Mac and PC:
=====================================

If the files are plain ASCII there are few problems (except perhaps for
conversion of line termination).  Use email, LapLink or Apple's 
`Macintosh PC Exchange' for reading and writing PC diskettes on a Mac.

Here we discuss issues that come up when the file instead has both
resource and data forks.  Such files are best represented on the PC 
in MacBinary format.  All of the utilities in the FMP that deal with
Macintosh files read and write them in MacBinary format. 

MacBinary format files have a 128 byte header including `finder data'
such as File Creator and Type followed by the data and resource forks.

In the case of font files, the data fork is empty -- all the action is in
the resource fork.  Consequently, the FMP utilities that read MacBinary
files have been modified to also read `raw' resource fork files.  This can
be handy when using Apple's `Macintosh PC Exchange', which splits the Mac
file into a file containing the data fork and a (hidden) file containing
the resource fork.

(1) Using the BINtoHEX and HEXtoBIN utilities in the FMP:
---------------------------------------------------------

To move a file from Mac to IBM PC:

Run the Mac file through Yves Lempereur's BinHeX 4.0 to create a plain ASCII
*.hqx file.  This can easily be moved to the PC using email, LapLink or on a
PC diskette written by by Apple's `Macintosh PC Exchange.'

Then decode it on the PC using the HEXtoBIN utility from the FMP (*not* any
other BinHeX conversion utility, or Eudora's `BinHex' attachment mechanism).
You will then have a file in MacBinary format ready for the utilities of the
FMP.

To move a file from IBM PC to a Mac:

Run the MacBinary file through BINtoHEX from the FMP (*not* any other BinHex
conversion utility, or Eudora's `BinHex' attachment mechanism).  You will
then have a *.hqx file that can be decoded by BinHex 4.0 on the Mac into a
real Mac file with resource and data forks (unlike what you would get with
the public domain BinHex or Eudora for Windows!).

Since the *.hqx file is plain ASCII, you can easily move it to the
Mac through email, LapLink or on a PC diskette read by Apple's
Macintosh PC Exchange.

(2) Using Pierre Duhem's MacDisk utilties:
-----------------------------------------

Pierre Duhem's utilities provide for reading Mac media on IBM PC.
They are available from http://www.macdisk.com/prospen.htm
The DOS version is downloadable shareware.  The Windows version must be
ordered. A bit pricey in comparison to Apple's Mac PC Exchange..

See notes on MacBinary format at http://www.macdisk.com/macbinen.htm
There are also some downloadable utilities to work with MacBinary files.


(3) Using the EXCHANGE utility with Apple's Macintosh PC Exchange:
------------------------------------------------------------------

Things are somewhat less convenient when using Macintosh PC Exchange,
since a Macintosh file is split into three parts on the PC diskette.

Transporting text and ordinary binary files is not much of a problem,
except that line termination translation is NOT automatic.

Macintosh PC Exchange writes the `finder information', the data fork,
and the resource fork into three separate files.  The data fork appears at
the top level in the directory, while the resource fork appears in a
sub-directory called `resource.frk'. The top-level file (for the data fork)
and the file in the resource.frk directory (containing the resource fork)
have the same DOS name, made up by using the first few characters
of the Macintosh file name (and prefixing this with the letter '!' if 
the name has to be truncated in the process).

The `finder information' is added to the hidden file `finder.dat'
that lives in the top-level directory.  This single file contains information
about all Macintosh files on the diskette.

The utility EXCHANGE provided with the Font Manipulation Utilities can be
used to convert between MacIntosh PC Exchange format (split files) and
MacBinary format (single file).

To see which files are available on a Macintosh PC Exchange diskette:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following to see exactly what files are available on the diskette in
Macintosh PC Exchange format:

	exchange -s <diskette>		e.g.	exchange -s b:

This will list all entries in the hidden file `finder.dat' that appear
to refer to genuine files.

To see more detail, such as the creation and modification dates, 
add the `v' (for verbose) flag.  In this case there will be several entries
that do not correspond to files --- such things as the Macintosh name 
of the diskette, the desktop file, and names of `folders'.  Ignore these.

To move a file from the diskette (split form) to the PC (MacBinary form):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following:

	exchange -m <diskette> <dos-file-name>	e.g.  exchange -m b: atm.scr

The resulting MacBinary file appears in the current directory.
You may wish to verify its integrity using the MACANAL utility.

The file names here are the DOS file names (as listed using `-s' above).
More than one file-name may appear, and wild-cards can be used. For example:

	exchange -m b: b:*.*

will attempt to convert all files found in `finder.dat' to MacBinary form
and dump them in the current directory (NOT on the diskette).  

Again, use `-v' for more verbosity.

To move a MacBinary file to the MacIntosh PC Exchange diskette (split form):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following to split a file in MacBinary format on the PC into
the files needed on the Macintosh PC Exchange diskette:

	exchange <diskette> <dos-file-name>  e.g.  exchange b: atm.scr

More than one file-name may appear, and wild-cards can be used. For example:

	exchange b: *.*

Will convert all files in the current directory that appear to be in 
MacBinary format and write them on the diskette. 

The utility can handle a diskette that already contains a file called
`finder.dat' written by Macintosh PC Exchange.  It is possible, however,
that you may have to remove the `hidden' attribute of the `finder.dat' file
in this case.  Do this as follows:

	attrib -H b:

Trouble Shooting Known Problems:
--------------------------------

Use MACANAL to verify the integrity of a file in MacBinary format.

Macintosh PC Exchange has problems with highly fragmented disks or disks
containing `too many' files.  Avoid working with Macintosh PC Exchange
diskettes that contain a large number of files.  Transport one -- or a
small number -- of files at a time if errors reported by EXCHANGE.  Use a
completely blank diskette to start with if errors are reported by
EXCHANGE. 

(4) Using LapLink (or Kermit):
------------------------------

Another way do this is use a serial cable and LapLink for the Mac.
There are three types of files one may wish to transfer:

*	ASCII text
*	Binary data
*	Macintosh files with both data and resource forks.

For ASCII text files, make sure that line terminations are translated.
Check the `Convert CR/LF' box in `Copy Options...' from the `Options' menu.

Make sure the `Convert CR/LF' is NOT checked when transferring binary data.

When transferring a Macintosh file with data and resource fork,
make SURE to check `MacBinary' format.

Kermit is also able to transfer files in MacBinary format.

MacBinary format combines in one PC file:

	MacBinary header with `finder information'
	the data fork
	the resource fork

The MacBinary header includes file name, file creation and 
modification dates, lengths of data and resource forks, 
and most importantly, file Creator and file Type.

It is easy to move files in this format back and forth between
platforms without losing any information.  The utilities in 
the `Font Manipulation Package' are designed to work with this format.
(Although many can also work with just the raw resource fork).
