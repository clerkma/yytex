    Installing "PS" Type 1 fonts for use with  MikTeX:
=======================================================

(0) Here we assume that you want to make the additions in a "localtexmf"
    tree rather than in "texmf" itself.  If you want to do it the other 
    way, just replace "localtexmf" in what follows with "texmf".

(1) Create a new directory for the actual font files so DVIPS can 
    find them. e.g.

    C:\localtexmf\fonts\type1\yandy

   It may be convenient to create sub-directores for different font 
   families (although this is not required), e.g.

    C:\localtexmf\fonts\type1\yandy\mathtime    MathTime 1.1
    C:\localtexmf\fonts\type1\yandy\mathplus    MathTime Plus
    C:\localtexmf\fonts\type1\yandy\lucidabr    LucidaBright + LucidaNewMath
    C:\localtexmf\fonts\type1\yandy\lucidexp    LucidaBright Expert
    C:\localtexmf\fonts\type1\yandy\em          European Modern

    Copy all of the PFB files from the font CD to the appropriate
    directory. The PFB files are at the top level in the font directory
    on the CD (e.g. mathtime, mathplus, lucidabr, lucidexp, or em).

   NOTE: you do not need the PFM files that are also at the top level.
   These are for installation of the fonts with Adobe Type Manager (ATM).

(2) Create a new directory for TFM files for the new fonts, e.g.

    c:\localtexmf\fonts\tfm\yandy

    Again, for convenience, you may wish to create sub-directories for 
    the font families you have, e.g.

    c:\localtexmf\fonts\tfm\yandy\mathtime
    c:\localtexmf\fonts\tfm\yandy\mathplus
    c:\localtexmf\fonts\tfm\yandy\lucidabr
    c:\localtexmf\fonts\tfm\yandy\lucidexp
    c:\localtexmf\fonts\tfm\yandy\em

(2a) There is only one TFM file for every *math* fonts, since math fonts
    have fixed encoding (character layout).  Copy the TFM files for the 
    math fonts to the above directory.  These TFM files are at the top level
    in the TFM sub-directory on the CD. In the case of Lucida fonts, the
    math font file names all start with "lbm".  In the case of MathTime
    the math font file names all start with "mt".  In the case of
    European Modern the math font file names all start with "emm"

(2b) For the *text* fonts, pick the TFM files set up for the encoding you
    have chosen.  These will be in sub-directories of the TFM directory
    on the CD with names like

    texnansi    (for TeX 'n ANSI encoding, LY1) <=== recommended
    tex256      (for Cork encoding, T1)
    ansinew     (for Windows ANSI encoding)
    standard    (for Adobe Standard Encoding)

    NOTE: Most font families do not have all four of these sub-directories.

    On older font diskettes, the TFM files for different encodings
    were distinguished using different extensions, .tft for TeX 'n ANSI,
    .tfa for Windows ANSI, and .tfs for Adobe StandardEncoding.
    In this case, copy the appropriate files, and then rename them to 
    have extension .tfm

(3) Select the font name mapping file for DVIPS (from directory
    PSFONTS).  These files all have names starting with "psfonts" and
    extensions that indicate (i) the font set and (ii) the text font 
    encoding, e.g.

    psfonts.mty     for MathTime + Times Roman using LY1 encoding.
    psfonts.mt8     for MathTime + Times Roman using 8r encoding.
    psfonts.mtz     for MathTime Plus (math fonts only).
    psfonts.lby     for LucidaBright + LucidaNewMath fonts using LY1
    psfonts.lb8     for LucidaBright + LucidaNewMath fonts using 8r encoding
    psfonts.ley     for LucidaBright Expert fonts using LY1
    psfonts.le8     for LucidaBright Expert fonts using 8r encoding
    psfonts.emy     for European Modern using LY1 encoding.
    psfonts.emt     for European Modern using T1/Cork encoding.

    NOTE: Each font set only comes with the files appropriate for that font set.

(3a) Copy the appropriate file to the directory

    c:\localtexmf\dvips\psnfss\

(3b) Also copy the file that defines the encoding vector to the same
    directory (this file is referred to in the psfonts.* file):

    texnansi.enc        For TeX 'n ANSI (LY1)
    8r.enc              8r (raw encoding base for Cork/T1)
    tex256.enc          direct encoding vector for Cork/T1
    ansinew.enc         For Windows ANSI
    standard.enc        For Adobe StandardEncoding

    These files will be in the ENC sub-directory on the font CD

    NOTE: Not all of these files may be present in a particular font set

(3c) Then add a line to the end of the DVIPS configuration file

    c:\localtexmf\dvips\config\local\config.ps

    that points to the font mapping file, e.g.:

    p+ psfonts.lby          or
    p+ psfonts.ley          or
    p+ psfonts.mty          or
    p+ psfonts.mtz          or
    p+ psfonts.emy

    Add as many lines as needed for the font sets you have, but
	do not refer to two conflicting files (such as psfonts.lbx and
	psfonts.lbz). 

	It may be necessary to also add these lines to the file
    \texmf\miktex\config\miktex.map (?)


(4) You may want to establish a separate directory for the new style
    files and font definition files under c:\localtexmf\tex\latex, e.g.

    c:\localtexmf\tex\latex\yandy

    Copy the style files (*.sty), font definition files (*.fd) etc. 
    from the CD (in directory PSNFSS or LaTeX2e) to this directory. 

    WARNING: You may already have copies of these files in 
	\texmf\tex\latex\psnfss.   HOWEVER: these may be the WRONG files.  
    So you may want to overwrite them with the files from the PSNFSS
	directory on the CD. 

    NOTE: To create lucidabr.sty, run TeX on lucidabr.yy NOT on lucidabr.ins
    The lucidabr.sty file created by running TeX on lucidabr.ins will not work.

(5) Also copy the AFM (human readable metrics) files.  Again, you may 
    want to create a new directory for them, e.g.

    C:\localtexmf\fonts\afm\yandy

    These files are in the AFM sub-directory. PS2PK uses these AFM files
	(It may be necessary to tell PS2PK about the encoding you are using,
	or to reencode the AFM files).

    Ignore the INF files, these can be used by Adobe Type Manager.


(N) What about virtual fonts?   There aren't any!   No need.
    If this seems disconcerting, create a directory called e.g.

    C:\localtexmf\fonts\vf\yandy

    And if you have the MathTime font set you can even copy the file
    mtmi.vf (and mtmib.vf, mtmih.vf, mtmub.vf and mtmuh.vf if you also
    have MathTime Plus) to this directory (although this is not needed)
    from the VF sub-directory on the font CD.

And that is pretty much it as far as installation is concerned!

===============================
	Using the fonts in LaTeX 2e
===============================

For MathTime, use mathtime.sty (math fonts) and times.sty (text fonts).  
If you do not have mathtime.sty run TeX on mathtime.ins to unpack 
mathtime.dtx and  mtfonts.fdd  into mathtime.sty and a bunch of font
definition files (*.fd).  If you do not have times.sty, run TeX on
psfonts.ins in your LaTeX 2e PSNFSS directory.

Check out mtoption.txt for MathTime package usage.

\usepackage[LY1]{fontenc}           % specify text font encoding
\usepackage[LY1,mtbold]{mathtime}   % switch math fonts
\usepackage{times}                  % switch text fonts (redundant)

For LucidaBright use lucidabr.sty.  This is created by running TeX on
lucidabr.yy to unpack lucidabr.dtx into lucidabr.sty and a bunch of font
definition files (*.fd).  Do NOT run TeX on lucidabr.ins.

Check out lboption.txt for LucidaBright package useage. 

\usepackage[LY1]{fontenc}   % specify text font encoding
\usepackage[LY1]{lucidabr}  % switch text and math fonts

For European Modern use the em.sty file provided

\usepackage[LY1]{em}

===================================================================
Using the fonts with plain TeX and miscellaneous other information:
===================================================================

If you want to use the fonts with plain TeX also, then create a 
new directory for the corresponding TeX source files e.g.

    C:\localtexmf\tex\yandy

Copy files like mtplain.tex,  mtplainx.tex, mtplus.tex, mtmacs.tex,
lcdplain.tex, lb-plain.tex, texnansi.tex, ansiacce.tex, stanacce.tex, 
dcaccent.tex etc. to this  directory.  These files can be found in 
the TEX (or PLAIN) sub-directory on the font CD.

You can also find in this directory on the CD (or a separate LaTeX209 
sub-directory) support files for LaTeX 2.09 but it is no longer 
considered politically correct to use LaTeX 2.09 :-!

NOTE: compatability mode in LaTeX 2e will *not* work for LaTeX 2.09 
jobs that use fonts other than CM - so if you are forced to run a
legacy LaTeX 2.09 job that uses other than the CM fonts, then you 
do need to use a *real* LaTeX 2.09.

--

If for some reason you need to convert font files from PFB to PFA format
or vice versa, look in the PROG sub-directory on the CD for pfbtopfa.exe
and pfatopfb.exe

--

On some font CDs, additional helpful information is available in plain 
text  files in the TXT sub-directory.

--

Encoding vector information may be found in the VEC sub-directory

===============================
Text fonts to go with MathTime:
===============================

If you have the IBM PC/Windows version of the font set on CD, then
you also have Adobe Type Manager (ATM).  This comes with a set of
fonts called the "Base 13" font set.  Each of the faces Times-Roman, 
Helvetica, and Courier come in four styles: regular, italic, bold, 
and bold italic. Symbol is the 13th font.

You can use these fonts as well, by copying the PFB files to a new 
directory called say

    C:\localtexmf\fonts\type1\base13

These fonts (and ATM) are, of course, copyright Adobe Systems, Inc.

=============================
Previewing with Type 1 fonts:
=============================

Many DVI previewers do not support Type 1 fonts directly.  Some 
link to GhostScript to do the rasterizing, or to some X-Window
"font server".  But more commonly free previewers only work with 
PK bitmapped fonts.

(1) Use the PS2PK utility to create suitable PK files from the Type 1 font files.

(2) An alternative is to run the DVI file through DVIPS and then use GhostView.

(3) Another alternative is to distill the PS file made by DVIPS using
    Acrobat Distiller (or GhostScript), and then view the resulting PDF 
	file in Acorbat Reader (*) or GhostView.

(4) Yet another alternative is to use pdfTeX and then preview in Acrobat
    Reader (*) or GhostView.

(*) The free Acrobat Reader is available from http://www.Adobe.com/readstep.html
