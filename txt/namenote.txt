Recommendations:

03d6	pi1	NOT omega1  (variant of pi, sometimes called omega pi) 

2126	Ohm		avoid Omega (see 03a9 for `real' Omega)
03a9	Omega		NOT Omega_

2206	increment	avoid Delta (see 0394 for `real' Delta)
0394	Delta		NOT Delta_

Questionable - don't know whether can be resolved:

00b5	mu versus micro versus mu1 (see also 03bc for `real' mu)
This is a tough one since font may not have both mu and micro or mu1
and don't want to lose glyph in 00b5

00af	macron versus overscore  (see also 02c9 for `real' macron)
This is a tough one since font may not have both macron and overscore...
and don't want to lose glyph in 00af

00b7	middot versus periodcentered (see also 2219 for mathdot)

Other Potential Ambiguities:

0110	Dslash versus Dcroat
0111	dmacron versus dcroat
20a4	afii08941 versus lira 
20a7	peseta versus Pts

dotaccent versus dot		in names of composites
dblacute versus hungarumlaut	in names of composites
cedilla versus commaaccent	in names of composites
