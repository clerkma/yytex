Design principles of `tex&ansi.vec':

*	Have accents and special chars where plain TeX has them hard-wired.
	(so don't need to do something like \input ansiacce or stanacce).

*	Make most accented / composite characters directly accessible
	(so don't need to use TeX's \accent mechanism)

*	Follow TeX text in 0 -- 127 as much as reasonable

*	Follow Windows ANSI in 128 -- 255 as much as reasonable

*	glyphs accessed only via ligature mechanism in TFM can be anywhere:
	ff/fi/fl/ffi/ffl	
	exclamdown/questiondown	 quotedblleft/quotedblright  endash/emdash

Following shows departures from Windows ANSI.

Not a good idea to use `control characters' (0 -- 31 and 127), but we have to...

0 -- 10		only CM has upright upper case Greek in roman text font...
		so forget this...

11 -- 15	ff/fi/fl/ffi/ffl	can actually be anywhere...

16 -- 17	dotlessi/dotlessj	\i, \j

18 -- 24	grave/acute/caron/breve/macron/ring/cedilla
		some accents occur again higher up:
		(96), 180, *, *, 175, *, 184 

25 -- 31	germandbls/ae/oe/oslash/AE/OE/Oslash
		all special characters occur again higher up:
		223, 230, 156, 248, 198, 140, 216

32		space (any sane font should have this)

% NO:	34		quotedblright (148)	keep: quotedbl

39		quoteright (146)		*not* quotesingle

% NO:	60		exclamdown (161)	keep: less

% NO:	62		questiondown (191)	keep: greater

NOTE: exclamdown and questiondown can go anywhere

% NO:	92		quotedblleft (147)	keep: backslash

NOTE: quotedblleft and quotedblright can go anywhere

94		circumflex (136)		*not* asciicircum

95		dotaccent (*)			*not* underscore

96		quoteleft (145)			*not* grave

% NO: 123		endash	(150)		keep: braceleft
% NO: 124		emdash  (151)		keep: bar

NOTE:		endash/emdash			can go anywhere

125		hungarumlaut (*)		*not* braceright
126		tilde (152)			*not* asciitilde
127		dieresis (168)			nothing in ANSI

So we have displaced 6 characters (out of 12 possibles) from Windows ANSI: 

	quotesingle (39), asciicircum (94), asciitilde (126),
	underscore (95), braceright (125), grave (96).

but not:	quotedbl (34), less (60), greater (62), 
but not:	backslash (92), bar (124), braceleft (123), 

The above should then be patched in higher up.

Conversely, we have moved down from Windows ANSI accents and special chars:

	grave (96), acute (180), macron (175), cedilla (184),
	circumflex (136), tilde (152), dieresis (168),
	quoteleft (145), quoteright (146), 
	germandbls (223), ae (230), oe (156), oslash (248), 
	AE (198), OE (140), Oslash (216).

but not:	quotedblleft (147), quotedblright (148), 
but not:	exclamdown (161), questiondown (191)
but not:	endash (150), emdash (151), 

(This opens up slots higher up that could be filled with other things).

There are eight gaps in Windows ANSI: 128, 129, 141, 142, 143, 144, 157, 158,
we need them for characters displaced from lower down:

	quotesingle (39), underscore (95), braceright (125), 
	asciicircum (94), asciitilde (126), grave (96), 

We can omit grave, because it appears at 18 now.

Finally, randomly filling in the gaps, and adding ogonek, Lslash, lslash....

128	braceright
129	underscore
141	quotesingle
142	ogonek	
143	asciicircum
144	asciitilde
157	Lslash
158	lslash
