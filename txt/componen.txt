                Y&Y TeX System Components          (compon.txt)
============================================================================

Y&Y's TeX System is sold only as a system;  i.e., only the font sets are
also available separately.  The system's components are:

  * TeX itself.  This implements the same language as the TeX you can
    get in the public domain --- but we have enhanced it in a number of
    ways.  For example, it `grows' its memory requirements as it needs
    --- so if you're processing a very large file, it doesn't choke on
    pre-configured memory limits.  This is a full 32-bit implementation 
    that runs `native' under Windows 95 and Windows NT.

  * DVIWindo. A full Windows NT/95 program that uses scalable (Type 1,
   `PostScript') fonts to display the DVI files created by TeX.  It
    has a `TeX Menu' from which you can access all of the other system
    components --- TeX, DVIPSONE, editor.

  * DVIPSONE.  A highly optimized PostScript printer driver for
    outputting your DVI files. (If you don't have a PostScript printer,
    you can *also* print, from DVIWindo, to *any other* installed
    Windows printer.  We do not have to provide additional printer 
    drivers --- you simply use what is available under Windows or
    what was shipped with your printer.)

  * Adobe Type Manager (ATM) -- the rasterizer that controls
    screen display in DVIWindo and printing to everything but
    PostScript devices.

  * PFE.  A Windows editor.  Shareware from Alan Phillips which we
    have licensed for inclusion in our system. (But you can also
    link any other editor into DVIWindo's TeX Menu.)

  * Your choice of *one* of the following three Type 1 font sets:
    (i) Computer Modern + `Extra LaTeX+SliTeX,' + AMS Font Set
    (ii) Lucida Bright + Lucida NewMath + Expert,
    (iii) MathTime 1.1 + Times + Helvetica + Courier,
    (iv) MathTime 1.1 + MathTime Plus + Times + Helvetica + Courier.
    (v) European Modern 
    Computer Modern is the `canonical' TeX font set...most public-domain
    versions of TeX use bitmapped (.pk) versions of CM.

We also supply the necessary packages and style files, supporting
plain TeX, AMS TeX, LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX2e.
