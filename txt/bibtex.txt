BibTeX:
=======

============================================================================

NEW: A new version of BibTeX is now included in the Y&Y TeX System typically
in c:\yandy\bibtex.  This version 

(1) reads "environment variables" from dviwindo.ini;
(2) deals with arbitrary line terminations;
(3) can handle long file names;
(4) has much larger limits on various arrays.

Installation of the TeX System already adds appropriate variables
to the [Environment] section of dviwindo.ini including
BIBINPUTS, BSTINPUTS, and CSFINPUTS. For example:

BIBINPUT=c:/yandy/texinput/bibinput;c:/yandy/bibtex/bib
BSTINPUT=c:/yandy/texinput/bstinput;c:/yandy/bibtex/bst
CSFINPUT=c:/yandy/texinput/csfinput;c:/yandy/bibtex/csf
BIBTEX_CSFILE=88591lat.csf

You can link BibTeX into your TeX menu like any other program
as explained in the Y&Y TeX System manual.  Hold down the Ctrl
key, from the "TeX Menu" select the item *before* the one where
you want BibTeX to appear, then edit the "key" and "value" fields
and click "Add".

You can also call BinTeX from the WInEdt editor. But then
note that sometimes WinEdt is set up to use the old
"c:\yandy\util\bibtex.exe" instead of the new
"c:\yandy\bibtex\bibtex.exe".  In that case, just 
reconfigure the definitions for WinEdt's menu item for BibTeX.

============================================================================

OLD: An older, simpler version of BibTeX is in the `util' sub-folder of 
the `yandy' folder, typically c:\yandy\util\bibtex.exe

If you use this version, then you may find it easiest to assemble all
needed files in one directory.  Then run BibTeX from the command
prompt after making that directory the current directory.  That way
you know all the files are there and that BibTeX is not grabbing old
versions of any of the files by mistake.  You can get to the command
prompt from "Start > Programs > Command Prompt".

For serious work, you may prefer to use a more elaborate version.  On the 
CD look in /CTAN/systems/win32/bibtex.exe for a larger version.  Copy this 
to your util folder.  Also copy kpathsea.dll in that case (see kpathsea.pdf 
for documentation if needed).

You can control where this BibTeX looks for *.BIB and *.BST files using
two environment variables  BIBINPUTS, BSTINPUTS.  Note that these are real 
DOS environment variables, not entries in the [Environment] section of 
dviwindo.ini.

In Windows 95/98 add to your autoexec.bat file (in your root directory)
lines of the form:

	SET BIBINPUTS=c:\yandy\texinput\bibinput
	SET BSTINPUTS=c:\yandy\texinput\bstinput

Please substitute the correct full path to where your files actually are.
then reboot.  

In Windows NT, set environment variables from "Start > Settings > Control
Panel > System" Click the "Advanced" tab, click on "Environment Variables".
Click on "Add" under "Variables" (not "System Variables").  You don't need 
to reboot in this case.

Note that this BibTeX - unlike Y&Y TeX itself - does not like long file 
names --- which is why the actual directories names given as exaples above
are not longer than 8 characters.  The environment variables themselves,
however, ve no such restriction and should be written as shown with the full 
9 letters.

Note that this BibTeX - unlike Y&Y TeX - assumes that your files use
standard line terminations.  This can lead to complaints about
`exceeding BibTeX's input buffer' if you transfer files from Mac or 
Unix without translating the line terminations.

You can also get this error message if you have unusually long biblio
entries.  BibTeX was not designed to accept whole abstracts as entries.
