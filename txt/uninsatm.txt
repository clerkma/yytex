Uninstalling ATM:
-----------------

This is described in the ATM manual.  Details differ depending on version
of ATM and version of Windows and directories chosen for installation.

First try locating an uninstall icon for ATM via 
`Start > Programs > Adobe Type Manager'  

If there is no such icon, try 
`Start > Settings > Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs'
Select `Adobe Type Manager' and click `Add/Remove'

If there is no listing for ATM, continue in brute force mode:

In the ATM control panel turn ATM off. Reboot.

Then, in the [boot] section of system.ini, change

	system.drv=atmsys.drv
	atm.system.drv=system.drv

to	system.drv=system.drv.	Reboot.  

Then you can flush atm.ini and atmreg.atm in your
windows diretory, as well as atm32.dll in your
systems directory.  You can also flush atmfm.exe 
from your fonts directory (typically c:\psfonts).
The Type 1 fonts are typically in c:\psfonts - 
if you don't plan to use them you can delete those as well.
