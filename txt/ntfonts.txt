Installing Type 1 fonts in Windows NT (details)			(ntfonts.txt)
=============================================================================

You can use Type 1 fonts in Windows NT in two different ways:
(i) without Adobe Type Manager (ATM), or (ii) with ATM 4.0 for NT.
Note that ATM 4.0 for 95 will not run on NT, and vice versa.

If you have ATM 4.0 for NT, just use that.  Otherwise read on.

You can install Type 1 fonts and have them automatically converted
to TrueType form (provided the font vendor permits this).  Unfortunately,
this works slightly different in Windows NT 4.0 than in NT 3.51.  In addition
there are some `misfeatures' in the registration of font names (namely
converted fonts are registered under a mangled PS FontName, not FullName).

If possible, first replace T1INSTALL.DLL in the `system32' subfolder of your
`windows' folder, with the modified version supplied with Y&Y TeX.  The
modified version is in the T1INSTAL folder on the CD ROM or the third Y&Y TeX
System diskette.  May sure to pick the correct version for your system ---
please refer to t1install.txt for details.

To install fonts, in Windows NT 3.51 use the `Fonts' icon in the `Control
Panel.'  The `Control Panel' is in the `Main' program group.  Select `Install
New Font' from the `File' menu.  Remove fonts by selecting them and then
selecting `Delete' from `File.'

In Windows NT 4.0 you can drag and drop font files (*.PFM) into the `Fonts'
folder in your `Windows' folder using NT Explorer.  You can remove fonts by
dragging them to the `Recycle Bin.'  Note that in Windows NT 4.0 the font
folder does *not* show the file name, but the name under which the font is
registered.  To see the file name, select the font file, then `Properties'
from `File' menu.  To see the Windows `Face Name' instead of the `Full Name'
select `Hide Variations' from `View' (but remember to uncheck this again).

When you install fonts, elect to have the Type 1 fonts made available to the
PostScript printer driver (so the converted TrueType versions will be used
*only* for on screen display, and the original Type 1 fonts will be used for
printing on PS printers).  Check all three check boxes in the dialog box:

	`Convert Type 1 Font to TrueType',
	`Install Type 1 Font Files for use on a PostScript Printer', and
	`Copy Type 1 Font Files to Fonts Folder'.

NOTE: to avoid some of the font name problems described below, you should
also run the `setupttf' utility after installing new fonts using this method.
SETUPTTF.EXE is a utility that comes with Y&Y TeX System.  In release 2.0 of
Y&Y TeX System this application is in the `util' subfolder (typically
c:\yandy\util\setupttf.exe).

The main purpose of SETUPTTF is to deal with the fact that some auto
converted fonts are registered under the wrong name.

There are some additional font naming problems, however.  For example, the
font `Wingdings' may be registered under the name `WingDings'.
Misregistration problems of this type can sometimes be fixed by editing the
registry.  Alternatively, in Windows NT 3.51:

(i) make a copy of TTF file of the offending font in a temporary folder;
(ii) uninstall the font (select the font and then `Delete' from `File' menu);
(iii) reinstall from the temporary folder.

In Windows NT 4.0, (i) drag the font file to the desktop from the `fonts'
folder to uninstall it, (ii) drag the font back from the desktop into the
`Fonts' folder to reinstall (and delete the copy on the desktop).

Note that currently in Windows NT 4.0, all non text fonts (including all CM
fonts) are shown as Wingdings after conversion --- except in DVIWindo!

Service Pack 4 for Windows NT 3.51:
-----------------------------------

Do *NOT* install service pack 4 for Windows NT 3.51

It has bugs in the TrueType rasterizer that prevents it from dealing
correctly with fonts that use the `control character range' (char code 0 --
31).  This makes all CM, extra LaTeX + SLiTeX, and AMS fonts unusable 
when converted to TrueType form on such systems.

These bugs have been fixed in the final release of NT 4.0 (and supposedly
also in service pack 5 for NT 3.51).

Font Naming Issues:
-------------------

*	The best way to deal with this is to just run the SETUPTTF utility as
*	described above.  If you want to understand the details read on.

One of the problem with the automatic conversion of Type 1 to TrueType
in Windows NT 3.51 is that it installs the fonts under a `mangled' FontName.

*    Note that this is not a problem for fonts that have the same PS FullName
*    and PS FontName (such as the CM, extra LaTeX + SliTeX and the AMS fonts).

Real problems occur with fonts where the mangled FullName is not the same as
the FontName (i.e. most fonts other than CM or AMS fonts).  If you look with
the `registry editor' in the registry under

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MicroSoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts

you will see that the fonts are installed using the *PostScript FontName* 
--- but with hyphens replaced with spaces.  The actual TrueType font files on
the other hand use the *PostScript FullName*.

    In Windows NT 3.51, the registry editor is regedt32.exe in the system32
    directory (typically c:\windows\system32).  In Windows NT 4.0 use
    regedit.exe in the windows directory (typically c:\winnt).
    You can set up an icon to make it convenient to call the Registry Editor
    (Use `New' in the `File' menu of Progam Manager). 

The information entered into the registry is wrong if the PS FullName is 
not the same as the mangled PS FontName.  This means that the relationship
between font name and file name cannot be recovered by an application.  

-------------------------------------------------------
Work Around for Font Naming Problem in Windows NT 3.51:
-------------------------------------------------------

(1) Install the Type 1 fonts as described above. During this installation you
    will see font names *without* spaces between name components, such as
    `LucidaBright'.  These are the *wrong* names. 

(2) Identify the *.TTF (and *.FOT) font files that correspond to
    the just converted Type 1 fonts.  These files will be in the `systems'
    directory (typically c:\windows\system) or in the `fonts' directory
    (typically c:\windows\fonts).  The files have the same name as the
    original Type 1 font files (*.PFB and *.PFM), just different extensions.
    You can list the PFB files on the font diskette to get their names.

(3) Move all of these *.TTF (and *.FOT) files to a temporary directory.
    Make sure to *delete* them from their original installed location (or 
    you end up with several copies of the font files using different names).

(4) In Windows NT 3.51, go into `Fonts' in `Control Panel' (in the `Main'
    program group), select all of the newly installed fonts and `Remove' them
    (Just to be safe check the `Delete Font File from Disk' box!).
    In Windows NT 4.0 you could instead open the `Fonts' folder in your
    `Windows' folder from the Explorer.  Select the fonts you want to remove
    and then select `Delete' from the `File' menu. 

(5) Finally select `Add,' navigate to the temporary directory with
    the copies of the *.TTF (and *.FOT) files, select them all and re-install.
    During this `installation' you will see font names with spaces between
    name components, such as `Lucida Bright'  When using the TTF (and FOT)
    files the installer picks up the correct name.

While the above procedure is relatively straightforward, some mis-features of
Windows NT can conspire to make this a somewhat frustrating process:

(1) `Removing' the fonts may not in fact delete the corresponding *.TTF and
    *. FOT files from the system directory (typically c:\windows\system).
    You may want to check, and delete the files manually if they are still
    there. However, you may find that you cannot delete the *.TTF or *FOT
    files from the system directory --- you may get an error message that the
    files are `in use by another process' (presumably the TrueType font
    rasterizer).  This usually happens if an attempt has been made to use the
    font since you last rebooted.

*   The only way out is to *reboot* and then again try to delete the files.
    It is important to delete these files to avoid cluttering your disk with
    several copies of the same font, and getting the system (or yourself)
    confused about which version of a font is installed.

(2) Windows NT 3.51 does a poor job of managing TTF (and FOT) files.  It does
    not delete or overwrite old versions when you install a new version of a
    font. Instead, it adds a version number to the end of the file name.
    After a while you can end up with numerous copies of the same font file,
    and you may not know which of these is actually being used (of course, 
    this wouldn't be much of a problem if you didn't always have to reinstall
    auto-converted font, as described above :=).

*	The solution is to make sure to first delete the old TTF (and FOT)
*	files --- do not depend on `Delete Font File from Disk' check box.
*	You may have to reboot first to delete fonts that are `in use'.

(3) Windows NT 3.51 does a poor job of managing font information in the
    registry.  You may find that the information there is not in sync with
    reality.  There may be fonts listed there for which there are no TTF (or
    FOT files). Conversely, there may be fonts `installed' for which there is
    no entry in the registry.  The best solution to such problems is to use
    the registry editor to open 

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts

    highlight each font to be removed and press delete, then click on `Yes'.
    Again this wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for the
    fact that you have to reinstall the autoconverted fonts.

Example registry contents after re-installing fonts:
----------------------------------------------------

After (re-)installing the `Lucida Bright + Lucida New Math' font set
in Windows NT 3.51, for example, you should have entries of the form:

	Lucida Blackletter (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBL.FOT
	Lucida Bright (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBR.FOT
	Lucida Bright Italic (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBI.FOT
	Lucida Bright Demibold (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBD.FOT
	Lucida Bright Demibold Italic (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBDI.FOT
	Lucida Bright Oblique (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBSL.FOT
	Lucida Calligraphic Italic (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBC.FOT

in Windows NT 4.0 you will see instead entries of the form:

	"Lucida Console (TrueType)"="LUCON.TTF"
	"Lucida Sans Unicode (TrueType)"="L_10646.TTF"

(1) If you instead see file names like LBL____0.TTF (or LBL____0.FOT), then
    you most likely have  multiply copies of the font files, and may run into
    problems because the wrong version is used, see above.

(2) If the font names do not have spaces between name components ---
    e.g. `LucidaBright Oblique' instead of `Lucida Bright Oblique' ---
    then you have the fonts installed under the wrong name.  You need 
    to reinstall the *TTF (and *.FOT) files --- see above.

*****************************************************************************

Changes to DVIWINDO.INI:
------------------------

You may also need to add  UseGetProfileTT=1  to the [Window] section of the
`dviwindo.ini' file so that DVIWindo refers to the registry rather than
`win.ini' (In Windows NT, GetProfileString() calls on the [Fonts] section 
are redirected to the registry).

If you do not see ligatures (fi, fl, ff, ffi, ffl) when using CM fonts, 
then you may need to add TTRemap=1 to the [Window] section of `dviwindo.ini'
If this does not solve the problem try adding Remap=2.


Using the SETUPTTF.EXE utility:
-------------------------------

If the above appears troublesome, use the utility `setupttf.exe' supplied 
with Y&Y TeX to update the [Fonts] section of your win.ini file.  Run

	setupttf -vfmn

on the command line to have it look through your *.TTF (or *.FOT) files and
create (or update) a [TTFonts] section in win.ini.

Setupttf tries to find WIN.INI and all the fonts on its own.  If your
directory structure is very unusual it may not succeed.  If your WIN.INI file
is not in the standard place (c:\windows), then you may need to give the
windows directory using the commmand line argument -W=...  If your *.TTF
files are not in the standard place (c:\windows\system or c:\winnt\fonts),
then give the system directory using the command line argument -S=...  
(Try setupttf -? to obtain a more detailed usage summary).

Add  UseGetProfileTT=0  to the [Window] section of the dviwindo.ini file 
if you want DVIWindo to refer to the `win.ini' file instead of the registry
(i.e. if you decide to use setupttf.exe to solve the problem).


PSFONTS environment variable:
-----------------------------

The installation program for Y&Y TeX System 2.0 tries to find the Type 1
fonts copied by the font installation process.  If you have a very unusual
directory structure it may need some help.  When Type 1 fonts are installed
using the Windows NT font installer (instead of Adobe Type Manager), the PFB
and PFM files end up in the system directory, *not* in the PSFONTS directory.
Set the PSFONTS environment variable in the [Environment] section of
`dviwindo.ini' so it includes this directory e.g.

	PSFONTS=c:\windows\system	<- typical for NT 3.51
or	PSFONTS=c:\winnt\fonts		<- typical for NT 4.0

otherwise DVIPSONE will not find the fonts when called upon to print to a
PostScript printer (You don't need to do this on a dual boot configuration
where the fonts are already installed in the PSFONTS directory under ATM in
Windows 3.1 or Windows 95).

Fonts may have different `Face Names' in Windows NT than in Windows 3.1:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Font Installer in Windows NT 3.51 ignores the face name information in the
PFM files of Type 1 fonts.  This has several consequences:

(1) Face names shown in font menus may be different in Windows NT 3.51 from
    what they are under Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.  In Windows NT 3.51 the
    face name is based on the PostScript FullName.  For example,
    the font with Window face name `LucidNewMathArrT' will appear as
    `Lucida New Math Arrows' in Windows NT.

    This does *not* affect the Y&Y TeX System since the name by which TeX
    refers to the font is *not* the Windows face name, but the font's file
    name.  It does affect other Windows applications, however.

Misnaming can lead to problems with limited number of styles:
-------------------------------------------------------------

(2) Font families with many styles will be installed in such a way that only
    four of these styles are accessible.  For example, `Lucida Sans' has
    six styles: `regular', `italic, `demibold, `demibold italic, `bold'
    `bold italic'.  The Windows face name of the first four is `Lucida Sans'
    while the Windows face name of the last four is `Lucida Sans Bold'.
    Since Windows NT ignores the Windows face name, all six are merged
    under the name `Lucida Sans'.  Consequently only four of the six styles
    are accessible using `bold' and `italic' style flags.

    For example, if you try to select `Lucida Sans Bold' or `Lucida Sans
    Bold Italic' in `Fonts' from the `Control panel' then nothing will be
    displayed and you may get an error message of the form
	`There is a problem with the font file.  Cannot display font'

    If you try to use `lsb' or `lsbi' from DVIWindo you will get the error
	`Can't find font lsb' and `Can't find font lsbi'

    The only work around for this problem would be to change the PostScript
    FullName before conversion, which would make the fonts incompatible with
    versions used under other operating systems.

`Synthetic Fonts,' Obliqued and Narrowed Fonts:
-----------------------------------------------

In Windows NT 3.51, the automatic conversion of Type 1 to TrueType fonts does
not work properly with fonts that have a FontMatrix other than the standard
one.  This can affect `narrow', `expanded' and `obliqued' styles.

--------------
Font Encoding:
--------------

As of release 2.0.3, the Y&Y TeX System can reencode TrueType fonts in
Windows NT `on the fly.'  It will also reencode Type 1 fonts with ATM Deluxe
4.0 for NT.  So you can elect any encoding you like during installation.  We
recommend `TeX 'n ANSI' encoding, since it provides access to all 228 glyphs
found in typical text fonts (plus a few more if the font has them).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Installing and Deleting TrueType Fonts in Windows NT 4.0:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install a font, drag the TTF file to the \fonts subfolder of the windows
folder.  To remove a font, drag it from the \fonts subfolder to the `Recycle
Bin.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Font file name changes when TrueType fonts are `re-installed'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before installing a new version of a TrueType font, make sure to *remove*
the old one --- *including* the corresponding font file (TTF).  Otherwise 
you will end up with several copies of the font file with slightly different
names.  Windows NT automatically extends the font name with underscores
and modifies the last letter to create a new unique font file name.

For example, if you install LBMS several times without removing old copies
you end up with: lbms.ttf, lbms___0.ttf, lbms___2.ttf, etc.  This wastes
disk space and breaks the fixed relationship between font and font file name.

DVIWindo tries to deal with this problem when searching for fonts --- as well
as when you use WriteTFM, WriteAFM.  It always does find the correct font 
if there is at least one underscore between the original font file name and
the `version number' added at the end. If the original font file name is
already 7 or 8 characters long, however, and there are several fonts with
similar names, then this ambiguity cannot be resolved.  

The best solution is to avoid having more than one font file for a given font. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Mismatch in TrueType font full name list:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DVIWindo will warn you if the TrueType font list enumerated by Windows does
not match the information in the [Fonts] (or [TTFonts]) section of WIN.INI ---
or, in the case of Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 --- the registry.  The font
names alluded to are supposed to be the `Full Names' of the TrueType fonts.
There are three problem scenarios:

(1) Windows 95	Name error in TT font (Probably in Windows 95).
		Create a `ttfonts.reg' file (see below) or use the SETUPTTF
		utility to add [TTFonts] to WIN.INI.

This should not happen unless you have a font installed under the wrong name
(or you have an older version of DVIWindo).  Check the names in the registry.

(2) Windows NT	Name error in TT font (Probably auto-converted T1 font).
		Move TTF files (and FOT files in NT 3.51) to empty directory,
		`Remove' font; then `Add...' using `Fonts' in Control Panel

This is typically due to a bug in the T1 to TT converter in Windows NT 3.51.
Fonts are initially installed under the wrong name (see above).

(3) Windows 3.1	Name error in TT font (Windows 3.1).
		[Fonts] section of WIN.INI inconsistent, use setupttf -vfnm

This happens if (i) WIN.INI does not list all TrueType fonts, or (ii) if the
names do not match those supplied by Windows (This can happen, for example,
if the names in WIN.INI are not the English names of the fonts).  Or if some
application (such as `Equation Lite') installs fonts under the wrong name
(such as the file name instead of the actual font name). Use setupttf -vfnm.

In Windows 95 and Windows NT, information on TrueType fonts is stored in the
registry.  If you want to check the names of all installed TrueType fonts:

     Launch the registration data base editor (Click on `Start', select
    `Run,' type `regedit' and hit the Enter key).  Navigate down to:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts

    This shows the installed TrueType fonts.  You can write out this branch 
    of the registration data base into a file called `ttfonts.reg' in your
    Windows directory by selecting `Registry > Export Registry File.'  
    This is a plain ASCII file you can then inspect using any editor.
    And DVIWindo can use such a file --- and may in fact already have 
    forced RegEdit to write it.

In Windows NT font information is stored in the registry, but fortunately
Windows NT also pretends that it is listed in WIN.INI (for older applications).

NOTE:	You can turn off the above mentioned warning messages by adding
	IgnoreBadInstall=1 to the [Window] section of dviwindo.ini.

New bugs in final release of Windows NT 4.0:
--------------------------------------------

If you double click on a font in the fonts folder, you may very well get 
the wrong font displayed in Windows NT 4.0 (typically something totally
inappropriate like Wingdings or Lucida Blackletter).  If you want to see the
proper character layout, select the font in DVIWindo's `Show Font' instead.

There also appears to be a new bug in T1INSTALL.DLL having to do with
repeated encoding.  Some glyphs may only be accessible via one or the other
of the character codes that refer to it.  And the bugs in conversion of
`narrow' and other transformed fonts remain...
