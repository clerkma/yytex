Installing fonts with release 2.2
=================================

Windows 2000 Professional (W2K) has the Type 1 rasterizer built in.
Do not try to install ATM 4.0 in W2K.  Instead, from "My Computer"
open the "Fonts" folder (c:\winnt\fonts) and use "File > Install Fonts".
On the CD is a "psfonts" folder that has all the fonts in one place.

Release 2.2 includes ATM 4.0 for Windows 95/98 and ATM 4.0 for NT 4.
The fonts themselves are automatically installed when you install ATM.
If you need to install additional fonts later, use the ATM
control panel reached from  `Start > Programs > Adobe > ATM'

Release 2.2 makes it easy to switch encoding right from the DVIWindo
`Font' menu.  TeX metric files (TFM) for several commonly used
encodings are already installed with the system. You do *not* need to
reinstall the fonts if you change your mind later about text font encoding.

Preserving old preferences when installing release 2.2
=======================================================

Installing release 2.2 on top of an existing release 2.1 installation will
maintain the old preferences recorded in dviwindo.ini.  Release 2.2 installs
into the same directory structure as release 2.1.  So the TeX System itself
will be completely updated, yet files you may have added will be preserved. 

However, If you have an old c:\yandy\tex\latex2e folder, remove it and its 
contents. Those files are now all in a folder called c:\yandy\tex\latex.
You may want to check dviwindo.ini for references to the old folder.

If you want a `fresh' install, rename `dviwindo.ini' in the windows
directory (c:\windows or c:\winnt) to `dviwindo.bak' before installation.
Afterwards compare the new `dviwindo.ini' with `dviwindo.bak' to see
whether there are any special customizations you would like to transfer.

Uninstalling release 2.1
========================

You do not need to uninstall release 2.1 before installing release 2.2.
--- and, please do *not* try to uninstall 2.1 *after* installing 2.2

Uninstalling release 2.2
========================

Release 2.2 has its own `uninstall' procedure accessed via the control panel
in Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0.  From `Start' select `Settings', then
`Control Panel.' Double click the `Add/Remove' icon.  Select the application
you want to remove and click `Remove.'

Short Trouble Shooting FAQ
==========================

Complaints about incorrect TrueType font names under Windows NT:
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you do not use ATM 4.0 in Windows NT, make sure to run the
SETUPTTF utility (c:\yandy\util subfolder) after installing fonts.  
Add IgnoreBadInstall=1 to the [Window] section of dviwindo.ini

Ligatures are lost when printing to non-PS HP printer:
-------------------------------------------------------

Some PCL printer drivers in Windows 95 and 98 have problems with reencoded 
fonts. Check out `win95.txt' in `doc-misc' for series of recommendations.

Complaints about encoding errors in CM fonts:
---------------------------------------------

Please uninstall and remove all *TrueType* versions of the CM fonts from 
other vendors!  These fonts are incorrectly marked as `text' fonts and 
as a result DVIWindo will try to reencode them --- which makes no sense.
See also mknontxt.exe in c:\yandy\util for an attempt to fix these fonts.

  CM `text' fonts have a peculiar character layout that matches no other
  encoding.  They also contain fewer than the standard 228 glyphs expected 
  in a normal text font.  In additon they are designed to be used with fixed
  hard-wired encoding, not Windows ANSI.  This means that they must be marked
  `pi/decorative/math/symbol', *not* `text' -- as our CM fonts in Type 1 are.

Printing to networked PostScript printers:
------------------------------------------

When printing to networked PS printers have "Special > Use DLLs" and
"Special > Passback from DVIPSONE" checked.  In this mode PostScript
code is passed back from DVIPSONE and fed to the Windows printer driver.

"Printing" to Acrobat 4.0 Distiller:
------------------------------------

If you have Acrobat 4.0 installed, then Acrobat Distiller appears as an 
option in the "File > Print" dialog.  This will also check "Use DVIPSONE" 
In addition you can ask Distiller to automatically call Acrobat Reader on the
resulting PDF file. In this fashion you can "preview" using Distiller/Reader.  
In this mode "PostScript trickery" --- and EPS files without previews --- 
are supported since Distiller has a full featured PS interpreter.
