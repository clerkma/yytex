		Using Y&Y TeX System with Windows NT
=======================================================================

When using the Y&Y TeX System with Windows NT, one needs to be aware of
some difference between Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  If you have just
received your Y&Y TeX System then most of the problems described below will
already have been taken care of, except for font installation issues.
For details on problems with the automatic conversion from Type 1 to TrueType
in Windows NT, please refer to `ntfonts.txt.'


(1a) Avoiding `&' in file and directory names:

Windows NT (as some other operating systems like OS/2 and some DOS clones)
uses `&' on the command line as a separator between two commands.  This makes
it awkward to use executables named `y&ytex.exe' and directories like
`c:\y&ytex', environment variables named `y&ytex' (and TeX formats like
`&plain').  On the command line you *can* quote the & by preceding it with ^
(e.g.  c:\y^&ytex\y^&ytex.exe) but this can get awkward, and also works only
from the command line, not in a batch file.

	Henceforth the file and directory names `y&ytex' will be replaced
	with the names `yandytex.exe' and `c:\yandytex' respectively.

To make this change you will need to move the contents of the `y&ytex'
directory to a new directory called `yandytex'.  You also need to
change entries in `dviwindo.ini' that refer to `y&ytex'.  Change the name
of `y&ytex.exe' to `yandytex.exe.' And if you have batch files that have
hard-wired references to `y&ytex' these need to be changed as well (check
c:\bat\tex.bat, latex.bat, latex2e.bat and initex.bat)


(1b) Allowing `+' instead of `&' when specifying `format' for TeX.

TeX is told what `format' file to use on the command line using the `&'
For example: 	tex &lplain ...

will load up the LaTeX 2.09 `format' (that is, the file `lplain.fmt'), If no
format is specified, then TeX looks for the default format file `plain.fmt'.

When you call TeX in Windows NT from the command line you need to quote
the & by preceding it with ^ (e.g. tex ^&lplain) but this can get awkward.
It also does not work when a batch file is called from the `TeX Menu'.

	Y&Y TeX will accept + as an alternative to & on the command line.

If you are running under Windows NT, then look through the [Applications]
section of your `dviwindo.ini' file (in your Windows directory) and replace
occurences of &plain with +plain, &lplain with +lplain, &latex with +latex etc.


(2a) Windows NT can convert Type 1 fonts to TrueType form.

Use ATM 4.0 for NT if possible.  It is also possible - but not recommended -
to use the automatic conversion to TrueType format built into NT.
You can install Type 1 fonts from `Fonts' in the `Control Panel' (in the 
`Main'  program group) and have them automatically converted to TrueType 
form (provided the font vendor permits this).

When you do this, elect to have the Type 1 fonts made available to the
PostScript printer driver (so the converted TrueType versions will be used
*only* for on screen display, and the original Type 1 fonts will be used for
printing on PS printers).  We recommend checking all three check boxes in the
dialog box.

The automatic conversion is on the whole somewhat better than that provided
by commonly available font tools.  However, for commercial grade, hand hinted
Type 1 fonts --- such as fonts from Y&Y --- there will be a noticable loss in
rendering quality, since the original hinting is lost.  For less well made
fonts the converted version may well render as well as the original (because
the `auto hints' in the Type 1 version are likely to be not much better than
the `auto hints' in the converted TrueType version).

Math fonts present problems in Windows NT 3.5, because of misfeatures of the
conversion process.  Most notably problems with math fonts in Windows 3.5
occur because of (i) repeated encoding, (ii) problems with character code 0,
and (iii) with character code 173.

*	These mis-features have been fixed in Windows NT 3.51 --- so please
	get Windows NT 3.51!


(2b) TrueType fonts can be reencoded in NT

Text fonts do not present any additional problems.  The ENCODING
environment variable controlling `on the fly' reencoding effects.

It is possible to permanently reencode Type 1 text fonts *before* conversion
using the `encode.bat' batch file (which calls upon the utilities REENCODE,
AFMtoPFM, AFMtoPFM, and SAFESEAC).  The process is described in
`encoding.txt' --- we recommend TeX `n ANSI encoding if you decide do this.


(2c) Converted Type 1 Fonts installed under the WRONG NAME!

Please refer to `ntfonts.txt' for full details on this problem with T1INSTALL.


(3) Font File Name changes when fonts are `re-installed'

Before installing a new version of a TrueType font, make sure to remove
the old one --- including the corresponding font files.  Otherwise you
may end up with several copies of the font files with slightly different
names.  Windows NT automatically extends the font name with underscores
and modifies the last letter to create a new unique font file name.

For example, if you install LBMS several times without removing old
copies you may end up with: lbms.fot, lbms___0.fot, lbms___2.fot, etc.
This breaks the assumed fixed relationship between font and font file name.

DVIWindo tries to deal with this problem when searching for fonts, as well
as when you use WriteTFM, WriteAFM.  It always finds the correct font if
there is at least one underscore between the original font file name and the
`version number' added at the end. If the original font file name is
already 7 or 8 characters long, this algorithm may fail.  The best solution
is to avoid having more than one font file for a given font (this also saves
disk space!).

(4) Long file names --- tex.pool, lcircle10.tfm, lcirclew10.tfm

In DOS, long file names are automatically truncated to 8+3 characters.
This does not happen in Windows NT, even when the file system is FAT.
Consequently files called for in TeX with long names will not be found
under the DOS shortened names.

On a Windows NT installation with a file system that supports long file
names, you may want to  rename `tex.poo' => `tex.pool', rename `lcircle1.tfm'
=> `lcircle10.tfm' and rename `lcirclew.tfm' => `lcirclew10.tfm' (`tex.poo'
should be in the TEXFORMATS directory, typically c:\yandytex\fmt, while the
other files should be in one of the TEXFONTS directories, typically
c:\yandytex\tfm).   There is another alternative, however:

	On a Windows NT installation with a FAT file system (such as a dual
	boot configuration), use the new  -8  command line flag, which forces
	Y&Y TeX to truncated file names to the DOS 8+3 convention).
