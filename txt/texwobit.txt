TeX without bitmaps
===================

Switching to scalable outline fonts can bring significant advantages,
and it is easy to do, since TeX itself only cares about font metrics ---
not the actual shapes of glyphs.
It is the DVI processor --- previewer or printer driver ---
that has to deal with the fonts themselves.

Why switch to scalable outline fonts?
------------------------------------

The main advantages of outline fonts derive from their resolution 
independence: 

*	The same file used for proofing can be used for final output.
	There is no need to recreate the file when a device of different
	resolution is used.

*	It is possible to preview at an arbitrary scale --- zoom in
	or out as desired.  One is not restricted to a few scales for
	which bitmap fonts happen to have been generated.

*	It is possible to use a font at an arbitrary scale.  A font size
	can be chosen for example, that fits a headline exactly in the
	space available.

*	There is only one font file --- independent of how many different
	sizes the font is used at or how many devices of different
	resolution are to be used.

Switching to scalable outline fonts opens up a large universe of fonts.
There are 15,000 fonts in Adobe Type 1 format alone!  
The number of fonts available in TrueType form is also growing rapidly.

The savings in file space can be dramatic.  A typical set of PK files
for the 75 Computer Modern fonts takes more than 6 Megabytes.  
The Computer Modern fonts in Type 1 format occupy only about 2 Megabytes
of disk space.  

The savings is even more dramatic if high resolution devices are used, since
the size of PK files grows approximately lineary with the resolution of the
device, while one set of outline font files can be used for devices of any
resolution.  And printers of high resolution are now becoming common place. 
With outline fonts, there is no need to create special files for high
resolution type setting equipment, and no need to make a decision early on
about which particular device will be used.  The same outline font files can
be used for previewing as are used for printing.  No need for a complex
two-dimensional directory hierarchy of font files organized on
design size and bitmap resolution.
