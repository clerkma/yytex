===========================================================================
	Just Five of the Unique Features of the Y&Y TeX System:
===========================================================================

(1) Access *all* characters in a font (On-the-fly font reencoding):

The previewer (DVIWindo) is the only one supporting arbitrary user specified
font encoding (character layout) --- including the ability to make
`unencoded' characters accessible --- such as `fi', `fl', `dotlessi',
`dotaccent', and `ring' in Microsoft Windows (how do you show a derivative
without `dotaccent,' or quaternions without `ring'?).  Even `ff', `ffi',
`ffl', and `dotlessj' can be accessed if the font has those glyphs.

(2) Fast PostScript printing (Partial Font Downloading - pioneered in 1990!):

The PS printer driver (DVIPSONE) uses `partial font downloading', which can
reduce PostScript file size by a factor of 4 to 8 on small jobs.  This
greatly speeds up printing, and also reduces the chance of running out of
printer memory --- a serious concern since TeX likes to use lots of fonts.  

Partial font downloading makes PostScript printing a joy instead of a pain!

(3) Handle arbitrarily complex TeX jobs (Dynamic Memory Allocation):

Y&Y TeX is the only TeX on IBM PC that uses dynamic memory allocation.
It starts small and mean --- like a `small TeX' --- yet can handle jobs
bigger those that any `big TeX' with fixed allocations can handle.  And 
Y&Y TeX does *not* just grow main memory, but most types of TeX memory.

Also, Y&Y TeX is one of the very few providing for more than 256 internal 
font numbers.  Important when doing complex books like `The LaTeX Companion.'

(4) Quality font rendering (Commercial grade hand-hinted Adobe Type 1 fonts):

We only use high quality `PostScript' fonts.  In fact, we were involved in
the development of all of the Type 1 fonts specially made for use with TeX.
This includes Computer Modern, AMS, extra LaTeX + SliTeX, Lucida Bright,
Lucida New Math, and MathTime.  Outstanding rendering even at low resolution.
No problems with service bureaus that reject jobs calling for TrueType fonts.

We now also include ATM 4.0 for Windows 95 and ATM 4.0 for Windows NT!

(5) Make your own font `instances' (Support for Multiple Master Fonts):

Y&Y provides the only TeX system that supports this exiting new font
technology.  Multiple Master (MM) fonts are supported transparently to the
user --- including `on the fly' reencoding and even `partial font downloading'.
Metric files for MM fonts can be created right from the previewer.
And these metric files are complete with information for unencoded
characters, and have accurate character bounding boxes.

*	Y&Y TeX System --- the TeX system to use!

And there are literally dozens of other `power features' --- such as:
	Support for TIFF image insertion (as well as BMP format);

	On-screen previews of EPS files with headers (EPSF/TIFF/WMF or EPSI);

	Transfer of typeset material on clipboard (and it's *not* a bitmap);

	Hypertext links (jump to marks, other DVI files, even launch apps);

	Automatic conversion of hypertext links to Acrobat pdfmarks;

	On screen rotation and scaling of text and figures in Windows NT;

	Accurate font metric files constructed straight from the previewer;

	Text search in DVI file (even text with f-ligatures);

	Inclusion of fonts called for by %%IncludeFont in inserted EPS files;

	Device independent graphics using standard TPIC \specials; 

	Extensive support for `foreign' language keyboards;

	Ability to integrate any editor, not just the `built in' editor;

	Extended color support for text, rules, `monochrome' images; 

	Hyphenation pattern memory for as many languages as you want;

	Fully page-independent, resolution-independent PostScript output;

	PS ready for page imposition, color separation and direct-to-plate;

	Fully user customizable `TeX Menu' to call any DOS or Windows app;

	Full featured Windows editor included (no file size limit);

	Color coding of fonts (for debugging font switching macros);

	Easy font name aliasing to deal with non-standard font naming schemes;

	Path cache speeds directory search in LaTeX 2e (which opens files twice);

	Support for many contributed packages like psfrag, hyperref, xy-pic.

etc. --- all of which make Y&Y TeX a `must have' for publishers, service
bureaus, TeX consultants, authors, researchers, faculty and students.
