------------------------------------------------------------------------
(0) Sequence of installation, Customization and `Environment Variables':
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The installation instructions recommend that DVIWindo be installed *last*,
after Y&YTeX, DVIPSONE, the PFE editor, and ATM (and Lugaru's Epsilon,
Trigram's MicroSpell, Borde's TeXHelp etc. if you have those).  That way 
the installation procedure can do the best job of setting up the 
`environment variables' and the `TeX Menu.'   

If you *did* install in a different order, then you can run DVIWindo's
installation procedure again at the very end.  Just this time *uncheck*
all the check boxes selecting various file groups to install.  You will 
then be presented with the option to reset the `environment variables'.  
You will also be given the opportunity to reinstall the `TeX Menu'. 

Listed here are the `environment variables' used by Y&YTeX, DVIWindo and
DVIPSONE.  They are used to specify where various types of files may be found.

*	These `environment variables' are set up by DVIWindo's installation.
*	Typically you do not need to change them. This note is in case you do.

The `environment variables' are stored in the `[Environment]' section of the
`dviwindo.ini' file (which is in your Windows directory).  If you need to
change some environment variable, simply edit this file.  You do not need 
to exit Windows or reboot when you make a change.  Y&YTeX, DVIWindo and
DVIPSONE will pick up the new values the next time they are called.

NOTE:	Old versions of Y&YTeX, DVIWindo and DVIPSONE refer to DOS environment
	variables (which had to be set up in the `autoexec.bat' file).  Now,
	they *only* refer to DOS environment if variables are *not* set up in
	`dviwindo.ini'.  Changes to a DOS environment variable have no effect
	if the variable is also defined in the [Environment] section.

*	You can obtain the old behavior by setting USEDVIWINDOINI=0.

---------------
(1)	Y&YTeX.
---------------

Most of Y&YTeX's options are controlled directly from the command line.
Invoke Y&YTeX with -? on the command line to receive a command line usage
summary.  For additional details, see the list of command line flags and
arguments in Section 5 in the Y&YTeX manual and in the `readme' file. 

Y&YTeX also refers to environment variables.  The only really important one is:

TEXINPUTS    Where TeX source files may be found.  DVIWindo's installation
	     procedure sets this to a semicolon-separated list of directories
	     with TeX source files, e.g. TEXINPUTS=c:\tex;c:\letters;c:\books
	     The installation program asks for the directories on this list.

The following is needed *only* if you want to be able to call your editor
when TeX finds an error - by typing `e' (It's usually more convenient to just
keep your editor in one Window and to switch back to it when an error occurs).
The installation procedure sets this up if it recognizes the editor you use.

TEXEDIT	     A command line string that may contain: %d (replaced with 
	     line number),  %s (replaced with TeX source file name), and 
	     %l (replaced with TeX log file name).  See the `readme.txt' 
	     file for complete details, e.g. TEXEDIT=epsilon %s +%d

The following optional environment variables are *only* needed if files 
do not end up in the places that the installation batch file chooses:

TEXFONTS	Where TeX TFM metric files may be found.
		Not needed if all TFM files are in default TFM sub-directory. 

TEXFORMATS	Where TeX `format' files may be found.  
		Not needed if FMT files are in default FMT sub-directory.

TEXPOOL		Where TeX's string pool files may be found.  
		Not needed if string pool file is in the FMT sub-directory.

When used in DOS, TeX will write its output file in the current directory.
If you want to redirect DVI files, then set the environment variables TEXDVI
(You can redirect LOG file and AUX file output using TEXLOG and TEXAUX resp.).

When called from DVIWindo, TeX writes its output files either (i) in the
directory of the TeX source file, or (ii) in a common working directory that
you select.  Add a definition for `WorkingDirectory' to the [Window] section
of dviwindo.ini to use a common working directory for all DVI files.

For advanced users:
-------------------

Sometimes it is convenient to have a different set of directories listed
for TEXINPUTS when a specific TeX `format' is used.  If Y&YTeX finds an
environment variable with a name equal to that of the selected format,
it uses the value of that variable rather than that of TEXINPUTS.
So you can, for example, have environment variables named LPLAIN and
LATEX which list the directories with style files for LaTEX 2.09 (lplain.fmt)
and LaTeX 2e (latex.fmt) respectively  (Note that both have to *also* list 
the directories with your own TeX source files, as in TEXINPUTS).

Sometimes it is convenient to change `environment variables' when 
working on different book projects.  This may be done conveniently 
using a batch file.  In this case, do *not* list the environment variable
in the [Environment] section of `dviwindo.ini', so that instead the 
corresponding DOS environment variable may be used.

For additional details see section 3 of the Y&YTeX manual. 

----------------
(2)	DVIPSONE
----------------

Most of DVIPSONE's options are controlled directly from the command line.
Invoke DVIPSONE with -? on the command line to receive a usage summary.  
For a complete list see sections 6 and 7 of DVIPSONE's `readme.txt' file.  

Note that DVIPSONE also accepts indirect command line files (using @).  
This can be handy when the command line gets too long, or when the same
command line flags and arguments are used repeatedly.

DVIPSONE also looks for a file called DVIPSONE.CMD in its directory.  
This provides yet another way to provide command line arguments --- 
particularly useful when DVIPSONE is called from DVIWindo.  

DVIPSONE also refers to environment variables.  The only important one is:

PSFONTS   Where PS Type 1 outline font files (PFB files) may be found.
	  Set to a semicolon-separated list of directories. The installation
	  procedure normally figures out where PFB font files are kept.

The following is needed if you are inserting EPS files, TIFF images or
Windows MetaFile (WMF) images, *and* if you do not use fully qualified 
path names when calling for these files:

PSPATH	  Semicolon-separated list of directories in which inserted EPS
	  files, PS headers, TIFF files and WMF files are searched for. 
	  The installation program asks for the directories in this list.
	  Leave if blank if you do not use inserted EPS or TIFF figures.

If you are reencoding text fonts on the fly then the environment variable
ENCODING should be set to the name of the encoding vector you want to use:

ENCODING=texnansi

If you are reencoding text fonts to Windows ANSI, then the environment
variable TEXANSI should be set to 1 instead (do *not* set ENCODING here):

TEXANSI=1

This is what you should do if you use plain text fonts with Windows ANSI
encoding in DVIWindo and other Windows applications.  Note that DVIWindo's
installation procedure normally sets up ENCODING and/or TEXANSI.

The following optional environment variables are *only* needed if files 
are not located in the standard places:

VECPATH		Where encoding vector files may be found.
		The default is the DVIPSONE directory (or VEC subdirectory).

SUBPATH		Where font substitution files may be found.
		The default is the DVIPSONE directory (or SUB subdirectory).

PREPATH		Where DVIPSONE (and PKtoPS) preamble files may be found. 
		The default is the DVIPSONE directory.

For additional information refer to section 7 of DVIPSONE's `readme.txt' file.

(3) Adobe Type Manager:
-----------------------

If you are installing a new Y&YTeX system, then you have received version 3.01
of ATM.  You must install this version of ATM, even if you already have an
older version of ATM (such as ATM 2.51 say).  The reason is that ATM 3.0 is a
completely new program that has two fewer serious bugs than ATM 2.5.

If you are installing the Y&Y MathTime TeX system, then use the *boxed* 
(retail) ATM rather than the envelope (bundled) version.  This version of ATM
includes the real Times, Helvetica, and Courier font families.

To avoid conflicts with previous versions of ATM, turn ATM off first.
If there are problems after installation, make a backup copy of the 
ATM.INI file in your Windows directory and *delete* the old ATM.INI
before re-installing the new ATM.  In some cases it will be sufficient
to delete the old [Aliases] and [Synonyms] sections in ATM.INI

------------
(4) DVIWindo:
------------

The installation procedure for DVIWindo sets up an initial `dviwindo.ini'
file (in the Windows directory), which contains:

	(i)   default preferences		[Window]	section
	(ii)  environment variables		[Environment]	section
	(iii) the `TeX Menu'			[Applications]	section

DVIWindo refers to only a few optional environment variables, which are
shared with DVIPSONE and Y&YTeX:

VECPATH		Place where encoding vector files may be found
		(Needed only for `WriteAFM...' etc in `Fonts' menu).

DVIPSONE adds the `Use DVIPSONE' checkbox to the Print Dialog only if it 
can find DVIPSONE.  DVIWindo looks for DVIPSONE along the PATH, and in the
standard places.  When this fails it tries to find DVIPSONE in the directory
specified in VECPATH. So if the check box is missing, set VECPATH.

PSPATH		Semicolon-separated list of directories in which inserted
		EPS files, PS headers, TIFF and WMF files are searched for.

TEXDVI		Set only if you want Y&YTeX to redirect DVI file output.  
		If defined, DVIWindo looks for DVI files to `Preview'
		in this directory rather than the `TeX Menu' default.

You don't normally need to edit `dviwindo.ini', since the preferences can 
be set from DVIWindo's `Preference' menu.  Should `dviwindo.ini' ever get
hopelessly corrupted, make a backup copy and delete the [Window] section.
DVIWindo will build a new one the next time it is launched.  But it will 
*not* rebuild the [Environment] and [Applications] section.  You can do a
DVIWindo installation to rebuild these parts --- just uncheck the three
check boxes for loading the files for DVIWindo in the setup program.

The DVIWindo `readme.txt' file gives a complete list of what can appear in
the [Window] section of the `dviwindo.ini' file.  For example,
`WorkingDirectory' is set up during installation if you indicate that you 
use a common working directory for DVI files. 

Details of what appears in the [Applications] section - which is basically
the `TeX Menu' - may be found in the DVIWindo file `texmenu.txt'. 


-------------------------------
(5) Problems, Trouble Shooting:
-------------------------------

There are several `*.txt' files that address specific issues and suggest
trouble-shooting approaches.  For Y&YTeX, DVIWindo and DVIPSONE, start with
the corresponding `readme.txt' file, which contains *pointers* to these 
other resources.  Also look in `news.txt' for late-breaking news, if any.
