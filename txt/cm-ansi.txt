    Modifying CM text fonts for TeX 'n ANSI encoding:	 (cm-ansi.txt)
==============================================================================

The CM text fonts are not `normal' text fonts since (i) they do not contain a
full complements of 228 `standard' glyphs (even with the extra 58 accented
character in the BSR CM fonts from Y&Y) and (ii) because they do not use a
standard character layout (in fact, CM fonts use *ten* different character
layouts!).  In addition, the CM roman text fonts include upper case upright
Greek letters (these are used in math).  

For all of these reasons they must be treated as `symbol/math/decorative'
fonts in Windows (or on the Macintosh), as opposed to plain text fonts.

This means that CM text fonts are *not* affected by the ENCODING environment
variable used by DVIWindo and DVIPSONE.  Some users have wondered whether it
is possible to modify the CM text fonts so that they too can be reencoded 
`on the fly' as well.  

It is possible to do this.  We do not particularly recommend this, because:

While there are some advantages --- such as providing access to the
ready-made accented characters --- there are also some drawbacks.  One is
that the CM text fonts lack several glyphs users expect to find in text fonts
(such as left and right braces, less, greater, backslash, underscore, bar,
quotesingle, quotedbl, asciitilde, and asciicircumflex).  Another is that DVI
files made for the modified CM fonts will not be portable --- other users
using CM fonts the `normal' way cannot use DVI files made for the modified
fonts, and vice versa.  Perhaps most seriously, you will loose the eleven
upright upper case Greek letters since these are buried in the *text* fonts
(but see below for a work-around).

If you do use modified `CM' fonts, you should add  \input texnansi
to your source files to let TeX know that you are using the `texnansi.vec'
encoding vector instead of the CM text font character layout. 
In LaTeX 2e use \usepackage[LY1]{fontenc} instead.

Note that you do not want to touch the *math* fonts.  You can tell which fonts
are math fonts since they all have names starting with CMEX, CMMI, CMSY,
CMMIB, or CMBSY.  Math fonts all have hard-wired encoding, and special metric
files that should *not* be altered.

By the way, only DVIWindo supports `on the fly' reencoding.  If you 
want to use your CM fonts with other Windows applications and have them
reencoded then you may want to resort to the `encode.bat' batch file 
(see `encoding.txt' and `morass.txt') 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
    So, if you really want to make TeX 'n ANSI encoded CM fonts:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To make modified CM text fonts you need the original AFM files. 
These are on diskette C of the three diskette BSR CM font set from Y&Y.  

It is best to build up the new PFB and PFM files in an empty temporary
directory.  Let us suppose that all your PFB files are in c:\psfonts,
and all your AFM files have been copied to c:\psfonts\afm (if you use 
other directories then substitute these below).

(1)  From the DOS command line, create an empty temporary directory 
     and make that the current directory.  For example:

     mkdir c:\temporar
     cd \temporar

(2) `Standardize' the PFB files (that is, replace the encoding with
     /Encoding StandardEncoding def) using the REENCODE utility. 
     For example:

     reencode -v c:\psfonts\cmr*.pfb

     (do *not* reencode to the encoding vector you want to use later).
     Repeat this process for the other text fonts.

(3)  Make new PFM files set up for Windows ANSI encoding using the utility
     AFMtoPFM.  For example: 

     afmtopfm -v c:\psfonts\afm\cmr*.afm

     (do *not* reencode to the encoding vector you want to use later).
     Repeat this process for the other text fonts.

(4)  Make new TFM files for TeX, and copy them to a directory in the
     list of directories specified by the environment variable TEXFONTS.

     afmtotfm -vadjx -c=texnansi c:\psfonts\afm\cmr*.afm
     move cmr*.tfm c:\yandytex\tfm

(5)  From ATM control panel (double click on ATM icon in the `Main'
     program group), select the CM text fonts and click on `Remove'.

(6)  From ATM control panel, click on `Add'.  Navigate to the 
     temporary directory containing the modified PFB and PFM files.  
     Click on `Add' again.

You can check whether everything has worked as expected using `Show Fonts'
from the `Fonts' menu in DVIWindo.  You should see the new character layout
(as defined by the value of the ENCODING environment variable in the
[Environment] section of `dviwindo.ini') including ready-made accented
characters  (If you displayed Computer Modern fonts since you launched
Windows, but before you made the change, you will have to exit and relaunch
Windows for the changes to take effect). 

The upper case upright Greek letters should have disappeared from the layout.  
If you want to avoid losing the eleven upper case upright Greek letters in
the CM text font, then you may want to make a modified version of
`texnansi.vec' (let's call it `cmanansi.vec') by copying the eleven lines 
for the upright Greek letters from `textext.vec'.  You will then have to
move `dotaccent', `hungarumlaut', `ogonek, and `fraction' elsewhere if you
need access to those glyph (and make a modified copy of texnansi.tex).

(6) Add \input texnansi (or modified version) to your TeX source files.

To be politically correct you probably should rename the fonts so there
is no confusion with the `original' CM fonts...
