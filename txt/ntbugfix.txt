Fixing complaints about missing fonts in DVIWindo in Windows NT 4.0:
==============================================================

When using fonts other than CM or AMS, with the automatic conversion
from Type 1 to TrueType in Windows NT 4.0, DVIWindo may complain 
about `missing' fonts.  This is the result of `mangled' names in
the registry - which can no longer be fixed using the method that
worked for Windows NT 3.51.

Add:
----

UseGetProfileTT=0
UseTTMapping=0

to the [Window] section of dviwindo.ini in the windows directory
(typically c:\winnt\dviwindo.ini).

Run the SETUPTTF utility after installing all fonts (this is
typically c:\yandy\util\setupttf).

If the above does not entirely solve the problem, also add

UseRegEnumValue=0

Explanation:
------------

The above additions to dviwindo.ini tell DVIWindo not to rely on font
information from the registry.  Instead it will read the [TTFonts] section 
in win.ini constructed by SETUPTTF.

In the case of Type 1 fonts, the registry in Windows NT 4.0 contains
`mangled' PS FontNames, *not* Full Names as happens for TrueType fonts.
These registry entries are therefore quite useless, except in the 
case where the mangled FontName happens to equal the FullName (as is the 
case with all CM, extra LaTeX + SLiTeX, and AMS fonts).

Example: 

File name:	lms_____.pfb  converted to  lms_____.ttf 
PS FontName:	LucidaMath-Symbol
PS Full Name:	Lucida Math Symbol
Windows Face Name and style:	LucidMatSym REGULAR

Mangled name in registry: LucidaMath Symbol

Note that the mangled name does not match the Full Name (or the Font Name or
the Face Name) and hence is useless for accessing the font, or mapping
between file name and Windows Face name.

Annoyingly ATM Deluxe for NT will follow the same convention!
But at least in the case of ATM there is a way to directly extract 
the correct information.  So this problem will not occur.
