Font installation in Windows NT without ATM		(ntinstal.txt)
===========================================

You can use Type 1 fonts in Windows NT 4.0 with ATM 4.0 for NT, or by 
using the built-in automatic conversion to TrueType.  Unfortunately, 
this font conversion has a number of misfeatures.  This primarily affect 
fonts other than Computer Modern, the extra LaTeX + SliTeX and AMS fonts. 

******	We recommend you use ATM 4.0 for NT ******

If you do decide _not_ to use ATM 4.0 for NT, then read on.  If you use 
fonts other than CM and AMS now, or plan to later, do the following:

(1) Install the modified T1INSTALL.DLL

The T1INSTALL font converter in NT has a number of bugs that affect fonts
when they are reencoded by DVIWindo. To fix this, first replace T1INSTALL.DLL
in the `system32' subfolder of the windows folder --- typically
c:\winnt\system32 in Windows NT 4.0.

Before installing any fonts, rename the old T1INSTAL.DLL - T1INSTAL.ORG say,
and then copy T1INSTALL.DLL from \t1instal\winnt400 on the CD to the
`system32' subfolder of the windows folder.

(2) Installing the fonts using the automatic conversion to TrueType

In NT 4.0, open the `fonts' subfolder of the `windows' folder using Explorer,
then drag the PFM (not PFB) files from the CD to the fonts folder.
(In the case of MathTime on diskette, install fonts only after running the 
prepare.bat batch file in a temporary directory --- then install from that 
directory.)

Make sure all three check boxes are checked in the dialog box that is
presented.  The PFB files coresponding to the PFM files are automatically
converted to TrueType form.  In NT 3.51, double click on the `fonts' icon 
in the control panel and use `Install Fonts' from the `File' menu. 

(3) Providing proper font names.

If you are using fonts other than CM and AMS you need to run the SETUPTTF.EXE
utility from the `util' subfolder of your `yandy' folder.  This makes it
possible to access the fonts despite the fact that they are registered under
the wrong name by the font installer.  Always run SETUPTTF.EXE after you
install new fonts using the automatic font conversion.

See also `ntfonts.txt' in the `doc-misc' subfolder of your `yandy' folder.
