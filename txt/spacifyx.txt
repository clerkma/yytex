You may find the following notes helpful when adding a space to the math fonts.

(*) The math fonts do not have a space character, since they are not
    intended to be used for continuous text, but for individual mathematical
    symbols, operators, delimiters, and relations.  

(*) In fact, if you put letters from the math italic font next to each other,
    you will not get italic writing, but a sequence of apparently badly
    spaced letters.  Which is appropriate for math, since justaposition of
    variables is meant to indicate multiplication, and this is usually
    indicated by additional space between the variables.

(*) For detailed spacing adjustments, if required, character codes 252
    through 255 provide various kinds of thin spaces, including a negative
    thin space. 

(*) The math fonts do have an actual `space' character in 160.
    In the PFA file:	dup 160 /space put	
    In the AFM file:	C 160 ; WX 795 ; N space ; B 0 0 0 0 ;

(*) The math fonts have some other character in code position 32.
    For LNM-Italic and LNM-AltItalic this is `psi'
    For LNM-Symbol it is `arrowleft'
    For LNM-Arrows it is `notexistential'
    For LNM-Extension it is `parenleftBigg'

(*) `spacify' interchanges what is in 160 with what is in 32.
    It uses a very simple-minded method to do this.
    Since the PFA and AFM files are plain ASCII you can check on this.

(*) The characters from 0 - 32 use repeated encoding.  
    They appear again in 161 -- 195.
    Character 32 actually appears in three places: 32, 128, and 195.

(*) Some applications can only reference a character via the first mentioned
    encoding position.  So if 
	dup 195 /space put
	dup 128 /space put
    appears before
	dup 32 /space put
    in the PFA file then you may only be able to get at `space' using 195,
    not 32 as desired. Reverse the order of these lines in the PFA file to
    correct this if needed.
