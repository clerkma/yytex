Making fake condensed (narrow), expanded, and obliqued (slanted) fonts:
=======================================================================

In the Unix/DVIPS world, people often create modified versions of
`PostScript' (Type 1) fonts using `PostScript Trickery'.  This is
convenient, but device dependent.  The result is not an ATM compatible 
Type 1 font.  The easiest way to do such things on IBM PC is to use the 
`Font Manipulation Package' from Y&Y.  

You can do some of these things also by hand, with the utilities that
come with the Y&Y TeX System, although it takes a bit more work:

(a) Use PFBtoPFA on the file original PFB file to create an editable
PFA file.  Then take this file into an ordinary text edior (like PFE)
and change the FontMatrix line, which normally looks like

	/FontMatrix [0.001 0 0 0.001 0 0] readonly def

For example, to make an 82% narrow version of a font use

	/FontMatrix [0.00082 0 0 0.001 0 0] readonly def

You must also (i) change the /FontName and /FullName, (ii) change the
file name, and (iii) comment out the /UniqueID line (using %)
(The encrypted UniqueID will still be the original one, but it will not 
have any effect since it no longer matches the visible UniqueID - to 
change the encrypted UniqueID also you need the FMP).

Now use PFAtoPFB to construct the new PFB file.

(b) Edit the AFM file (this takes some work!)  Adjust all WX advance width
entries.  For the above fake condensed font, multiply each value by 0.82.
You do *not* need to adjust the character bounding boxes. Change the 
FullName, FamilyName, and the file name to match the PFB file information.

Now use AFMtoPFM to make a PFM file from the revised AFM file.

DO *not* use AFMtoTFM to make a TFM file, since the char bounding box are wrong.

(c) Install the PFB and PFM files from a common directory using ATM.
Check in DVIWindo `Fonts > ShowFont' to make sure it displays OK.

(d) Now use `Fonts > WriteTFM...' to create a TFM file for the font.

Footnote: 

The term `condensed' is reserved for a font that is not simply `squashed,'
but adjusted typographically to look right. Fake condensed fonts are usually
referred to instead as `narrow' fonts.  

Similarly, `obliqued' fonts are often derived simply by slanting an upright
font, while `italic' fonts not only are `written at an angle' but are
typographically different.  

Finally, fake smallcaps fonts made by scaling upper case letters are just
that: fake.  True smallcaps require a typographer's eye.
