In most cases you can print to networked PS printers just by selecting 
them from DVIWindo's Print dialog, and checking the `Use DVIPSONE'
check box.

Sometimes, however, there may be problems getting the correct port
designation or UNC.  And in some cases spooling from the command prompt 
may be disabled.  

Finding the UNC (or "share name"):
----------------------------------

If you experience problems, first establish what port the printer is on 
(e.g. Ne01:) and what the UNC or `share name' of the printer is 
(something of the form \\servername\printername).  You can check this in 
`Start > Settings > Printers.'  Right click on the printer icon in
question and select `Properties.'  Select the `Ports' tab and then the
`Sharing' tab.  In some cases you may need to ask your network 
administrator for help in establishing the correct UNC or `share name'.  

Make sure you can print to the device from DVIWindo *without* checking the
`Use DVIPSONE' check box (In this mode you won't get the advantages of the
special PostScript handling of DVIPSONE, of course).

Printing from the command prompt:
---------------------------------

Next check that you can print using the COPY command from a command
prompt.  For example:

	COPY /B c:\yandy\ps\test.ps LPT1:

Replace the LPT1: with your port designation (e.g. Ne01:), or with
the UNC or `share name' of the printer. If the UNC includes white 
space  you will have to quote it.  For example:

	COPY /B c:\yandy\ps\test.ps "\\W90NTSERVER\S2313_HP 4/4M Plus PS"

If neither of these methods (using the port name or using the UNC) works,
then you may have spooling from the command prompt disabled.  Check in
`Start > Settings > Printers' and double click on the printer in question.
Check its settings.  Make sure `Spool DOS print jobs' is checked. 

Capturing a printer port:
-------------------------

You may need to `capture' a printer port as follows (particularly 
if the printer is driven directly via TCP/IP over the ethernet):

	NET USE LPTn: \\servername\printername
	COPY /B c:\yandy\ps\test.ps LPTn:
	NET USE LPTn /DELETE

Where LPTn: is an LPT port that does not already have a real 
physical printer on it (e.g. LPT2: if LPT1: exists).

You can add /persistent:yes to the end of the "net use"
line to make the connection permanent (i.e. survive re-boot).

You could put this command sequence in a batch file
for convenience. In that case replace c:\yandy\ps\test.ps 
with %1 so it will pick up the PS file name passed as an argument.

Alternatively, you can add the "NET USE" command to your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file and have the printer remain "captured"
until you shut the machine down (do not use the /DELETE version 
of the command in that case).

Once this works, you can use DVIPSONE directly, either by
"installing" the printer on the new port from the control panel,
so that you can select that port in the print dialog, or by 
forcing DVIPSONE to always use a specific port.  To do the 
latter, go to DVIWindo, select `Preferences > Command Line >
DVIPSONE' and type -d=LPT2 into the field.  This will then
overrid any other port information supplied to DVIPSONE by
DVIWindo.

Windows PS spooling programs:
-----------------------------

Another approach is to have DVIPSONE create a PS file and then
use a spooling program.  There are two lpr utilities available
for win95/win98/NT:

Windows lpr spooler (Shareware):
http://ich210.ich.kfa-juelich.de/wlprspl/index.htm
Although mainly used as spooler, it is also capable of printing 
PS files on demand.

ACITSLPR spooler (free for private or academic use):
http://shadowland.hf.utexas.edu/acitslpr.htm
(address may change to  http://shadowland.cc.utexas.edu/acitslpr.htm)
When using this spooler, you have to use third party software
to print a file to ACITS' printer port, such as: 
- Ghostview (free) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/new27.html
  configured to print to a PS printer
- PrintFile (free) http://hem1.passagen.se/ptlerup/prfile.html

TROUBLESHOOTING AIDS:

(1a) You can see what command line arguments are being passed to 
DVIPSONE, YandYTeX, and AFMtoTFM from DVIWindo by checking
`Fonts > Show WinExe'.  

(1b) In addition you can cause the programs called in this fashion to pause 
when it starts and before it exits by checking `Fonts > Pause WinExe' 
in DVIWindo.

(2) To see what information Windows is providing DVIWindo when you print 
from DVIWindo, check for `LastPrinter=...' in the [Window] section of
dviwindo.ini.  For example:

	LastPrinter=\\W90NTSERVER\S2313_HP 4/4M Plus PS,winspool,Ne04:

This is a comma separated list of `device', `driver', and `output port'

(3) Normally DVIWindo will pass the `output port' to DVIPSONE using -d=...

However, in the case of a network port of the form Nexx: DVIWindo will
instead pass the UNC or `share name' (i.e. the `device' field above) instead
of the `output port' field in the above to DVIPSONE.  You can disable this
using UseShareName=0 in the [Window] section of dviwindo.ini

(4) You can also substitute for the port using an entry in the
[Window] section of dviwindo.  For example, the entry

	Ne04:=\\W90NTSERVER\S2313_HP 4/4M Plus PS

will force DVIWindo to pass along the UNC you specify instead of the port
Ne04: (which, in the example above, happens in any case, unless you have
UseShareName=0).

(5) You can also override any automatically generated port using an
explicit command line argument when calling DVIPSONE from DVIWindo.
Additional command line arguments for YandYTeX, DVIPSONE, and AFMtoTFM
can be controlled from DVIWindo's `Preferences > Command Line'.
If you add -d=LPT1: say, or

	-d="\\W90NTSERVER\S2313_HP 4/4M Plus PS"

then these arguments will be added to the command line. These new arguments
you supply will override arguments put in automatically by DVIWindo, since
the arguments you add appear *after* those generated automatically by DVIWindo.

Remember that you must quote arguments that contain white space.

(6) Sometimes you can get additional information by checking on printer
settings using MS Word (or other DTP application):

When you open the Print dialog in Word, look for `Name,' `Type' and `Where'
(these correspond to `device,' `driver,' and `output port').  You may be 
able to get additional information by clicking on `Properties'.
