The Y&Y Font Manipulation Package is a suite of over thirty command-line
MSDOS programs designed to modify font files and convert among different font
formats.  These programs do everything one could imagine doing to a font
except for editing character outlines, and they greatly simplify what would
otherwise be complex operations on existing font files.

Conversion Utilities

Font files are an alphabet soup of abbreviations.  As an example, PostScript
fonts normally consist of two files, one with the outline data and the other
with metrics (width, kerning, etc.) information.  The outline data may be
encoded as either a PFB (Printer font Binary) file for Microsoft Windows and
OS/2, a PFA (Printer Font ASCII) file for UNIX/NeXT, or a special Macintosh
format font file.  The metrics data may be encoded as an AFM (Adobe Font
Metrics) file used by Microsoft Windows, or a special Macintosh screen font
format.  Additionally, TeX, a popular typesetting Program with excellent
support for representing typographically complex mathematical formulae, uses
its own TFM (TeX Font Metrics) files.

TeX was originally designed to work with a particular set of bitmapped fonts,
but implementations that support PostScript fonts are available, including
Y&Y's own `bitmap-free TeX packages.'

The Y&Y utilities include programs to convert from any one of these outline
file formats to any other, and from any one of the metrics file formats to
any other.  Wherever possible, these conversions are exact; for example, the
PFA, PFB and macintosh outline formats contain exactly the same information,
and even hinting is preserved during conversion.  In other cases exact
conversion is impossible; for example, AFM files contain more data than PFM
and TFM, and the user may need to supply additional information when
converting from one of these latter formats into AFM.  The Y&Y utilities are
not designed for manipulating True Type fonts.

Modifications

The conversion utilities are probably the most useful, but the Y&Y package
also includes a series of programs for modifying system-wide information in
existing fonts.  Specialized programs can be used to reencode PostScript
outline fonts according to a user-specified vector (mapping files for common
assignments are included), rename characters, modify widths and sidebearings,
manipulate composite characters, merge the characters from two fonts into
one, perform simple geometric transformations (slant, condense, or expand
characters), and modify the encoding of accented characters to work around a
bug in Adobe Type Manager for Windows.

As is noted above, PFB and PFA files contain the same PostScript outline
information, but the PFB file is in a compressed binary format that cannot be
edited directly.  

For this reason, the font modification programs described here are used on
PFA files, and those who work with PFB files (OS/2 or Microsoft Windows) can
use the accompanying conversion programs to translate their PFB files to PFA,
modify them as needed, and then convert the new version back to PFB.

AFM files are plain text and can be edited by hand, but doing so runs the
risk of introducing incompatibilities between and AFM file and its associated
PFA file.  The Y&Y Utilities provide an encode batch file that is designed to
reencode outline fonts and all associated metrics files simultaneously,
thereby ensuring that the same encoding vector is maintained throughout.  
An accompanying decode batch file can be used to verify whether a set of
outline and metrics files for a single font implement the same encoding.  

Miscellaneous

Finally the Y&Y utilities include a handful of other tools, some of which do
not manipulate fonts directly, but can nonetheless be useful when working
with PostScript printers.  These include:

MODEX can set serial port baud rates as high as 57600.  
DOWNLOAD can download fonts, reset the printer, and request a font list from
	the printer, 
SERIAL provides facilities for communicating with a printer over a serial Line.
NAMECASE changes the case of font names in PostScript files.  
MACANAL show fork information for a Macintosh file.  
EHANDLER.PS is an improved PostScript error handler that can be downloaded to
	the printer. 

Documentation

The printed and on-line documentation is brief but comprehensive, and full of
hints and suggestions not only about the accompanying utilities, but about
font encoding in general.  However, it also presumes a general understanding
of font encoding issues, such as those outlined in the accompanying sidebar,
and users who are not familiar with font encoding vectors or the way Windows
remaps AdobeStandardEncoding fonts to Windows ANSI may have trouble grasping
some of the details.  This is unimportant for simple conversions, but
understanding these issues is crucial to deriving full benefit from several
of the modification utilities.  Users are expecially encouraged to read the
on-line morass.txt file, which provides a good introduction to font encoding
issues in the guise of what the documentation describes as `a diatribe
about the font encoding problem' and how to deal with it.

Conclusion

The Y&Y Outline Fonts and Font Metrics Manipulation Package is an exceptional
suite of tools, thoughtfully designed to provide access to just about any
part of a font file that a user might want to change except individual
character outlines.  It overlaps somewhat in function with Fontographer (both
programs can reset character widths, for example), but users will find that
certain operations are more easily performed at the command line with the Y&Y
utilities, while others are more easily performed in Fontographer's
graphical environment.  Some degree of knowledge about font architecture is
required to use the utilities successfully, but much of this available in the
accompanying documentation.
