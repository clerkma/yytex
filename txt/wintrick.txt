Useful Windows and command prompt `tricks'  (wintrick.txt):
-----------------------------------------------------------

Q: I can't seem to find files with extension .ini or .exe when browsing.

A: By default, Windows Explorer does not show extensions on some file names
(like .exe, .bat, .ini, .dll), which can be a source of great confusion.

Double click `My Computer'  Select `View > Folder Options'  Select 
the `View' tab.  Uncheck `Hide file extensions for known file types'
under `Files and Folders'.

Q: I don't seem to have t1instal.dll (or other file) on my NT machine.

A: Explorer may be hiding files from you.  Particularly if you are
not logged in as the `Administrator'.

Double click `My Computer' Select `View > Folder Options' Select the `View'
tab.  Open `Hidden Files' and make sure that `Show all files' is selected.  

Q: I need to run a utility (like SETUPTTF or ATMREGAN) but I don't know 
where it is (and I have misplaced my manual).  How do I find the file?

A: see answer to next question.

Q: Sometimes TeX (or I) get(s) confused because several versions of a
file may exist on my machine.  How can I find them all?

A: In Windows Explorer select `Tools > Find > Files or Folders'.
Make sure to check `Include subfolders'.

Alternatively, you can drop into a command prompt and use the DIR
command with the /s (recurse subfolders) flag.

Q: How do I upgrade all copies of a particular file found on my machine?

A: You can drop into a command prompt and use the REPLACE command
with the /u (update) /p (prompt) and /s (recurse subfolders) flags.
Be careful with files that have commonly used names (like README.TXT)!
Always use the /p flag so you can control which files are actually
get to be replaced.

Q: What is the easiest way to install TrueType fonts in NT
(and Type 1 fonts when not using ATM 4.0 for NT)?

A: There are several ways, but probably the easiest is the following:
Drag the .ttf (in the case of TrueType) or .pfm (in the case of
Type 1) to the `fonts' folder (in your windows folder).  You can use
Windows Explorer to open the `fonts' folder and the folder from where
you are installing the fonts.  Or start from `My Computer' and click
on the relevant drive icons.
