Long file names in TeX	 (longnames.txt):
=========================================

If you install release 2.0, the correct long names will be used for the
handful of files that have long names.  Ignore this file in that case.

Y&Y TeX can handle long files in Windows 95 and Windows NT.  This leads
to a problem if the files are stored under a truncated, abbreviated name
(something that is ironically not a problem in Windows 3.1 or DOS).

Most file names in the TeX world are 8 characters or less, with file
extensions of 3 characters or less.  This way, names can be the same
on all platforms including DOS.

A few names, however, do not fit this pattern:

	tex.pool	used by ini-TeX when creating a new format

Y&Y TeX `special cases' tex.pool, and automatically looks for `tex.poo' 
if `tex.pool' is not found.

	lcircle10.tfm	font used by LaTeX in picture environment
	lcirclew10.tfm	font used by LaTeX in picture environment

In addition, some style files in the `tools' package for LaTeX 2e:

	longtable.dtx
	afterpage.dtx
	enumerate.dtx
	indentfirst.dtx

If you unpack files from a DOS diskette or from a ZIP file you may find that
you have shortened names, truncated to 8 characters.  There are a couple of
ways to deal with this (in decreasing order of desirability):

(1)	Rename the files to have the long names.  If you do this in Windows 95 
	using the `rename' command from the DOS prompt you will be in the
	fortunate position where the file can be accessed using *either* the
	shortened or the long name. For example, after

		rename longtabl.dtx longtable.dtx

	you can refer to the file by either name.

(2)	Use -8 on the Y&Y TeX command line.  This automatically truncates
	all file names to the DOS 8+3 convention.  You can add this command
	line option in the tex.bat batch file, or perhaps more conveniently,
	in a TEX=... line in the [Window] section of dviwindo.ini.

(3)	Shorten the file names in the source files that call for them.
