Wouldn't it be nice to be able to preview DVI files at any magnification,
not just those for which bitmap fonts have been pre-built?  Or to produce 
truly resolution-independent output that will run on any PostScript device,
whether image setter or laser printer?

Perhaps you are looking for an alternative to Computer Modern?  There now
exist outline font families complete with math fonts for use with TeX.  
Even if you want to remain faithful to CM, there are distinct advantages to
switching to the outline version of these fonts.

Described here are tools for use of TeX without resort to bitmapped fonts:

*	DVIWindo - only Windows based previewer using scalable outline fonts
	
*	DVIPSONE - only program using partial font downloading on Type 1 fonts

DVIWindo runs in MS Windows and DVIPSONE in DOS on IBM PC compatibles.  
Suitable font sets  - on the other hand - are available for a variety of
platforms, including Macintosh, IBM PC compatible, and Unix/NeXT:

*	Lucida Bright + Lucida New Math font set in Type 1 format.

*	Blue Sky Research Computer Modern font set in Type 1 format

*	AMS font set in Type 1 format

*	Extra LaTeX + SliTeX font set in Type 1 format

*	MathTime in ATM compatible Type 1 format


DVIWindo (TM) --- Windows based DVI previewer using scalable outline fonts
==========================================================================

DVIWindo is the DVI file previewer that uses scalable outline fonts.  
DIVWindo can display a document at any desired magnification.  
DVIWindo makes it possible to preview documents that use arbitrary 
outline fonts (not just Computer Modern). 

DVIWindo is an easy-to-use Windows application that shows images in 
EPSF and TIFF files.  Adobe Type Manager (R) is included.

Requirements:  

(a)	Support for scalable outline fonts --- 
	hence MicroSoft	Windows 3.0 or later ---
	in standard or enhanced mode ---
	hence at least an Intel 286 processor.

(b)	Outline fonts --- Adobe Type 1 (PFB) font files for ATM ---
	or TrueType fonts in Windows 3.1, for example.

Advantages of DVIWindo:
-----------------------

*	Allows previewing of TeX documents without the need for bitmap fonts;

*	Enables preview of documents that call for non-Computer Modern fonts;

*	Provides for previewing at any size, not just one of a predetermined
	set of magnifications - inserted figures are scaled correctly;

*	Printing to any device with a Windows printer driver, including
	HP, IBM, dot-matrix, PostScript and even some fax boards;

*	Copies regions to clipboard for pasting into other Windows applications

*	Uses the standard MicroSoft Windows graphical user interface (GUI).
	Hardly anything new to learn!

*	`TeX Menu' provides integration of DVIWindo, DVIPSONE and Y&YTeX.
	The `TeX Menu' is fully customizable - call any Windows or DOS program!
	

DVIWindo also has many advanced features, such as:

*	Supports the ten most popular \special's for figure inclusion ---
	shows preview images in EPSF and EPSI format files;

*	Insertion of images in TIFF format using \special;

*	Colored text, colored rules and reverse video using \special;

*	Text string search, two page `spreads', and `greyed text';

*	DVIWindo has \special's for hyper-text linkage;

*	DVIWindo supports the TPIC \specials for device independent graphics;

*	DVIWindo notices when the DVI file has changed and redisplays;

*	Preserves user preferences, graphical specification of zoom area;

*	Multiple instances loaded simultaneously to view different documents;

*	Display of list of fonts used, display of character sets in all fonts;

*	Creates AFM and TFM files for any scalable outline font in Windows.

*	Color coding of text in different fonts, and more...

DVIPSONE (TM) - the only program using partial font downloading on Type 1 fonts
===============================================================================

DVIPSONE produces truly resolution-independent page-independent PostScript (PS)
output from TeX DVI files.  DVIPSONE runs on IBM PC compatible computers
and uses Adobe Type 1 (R) outline fonts (in ATM compatible form).  
DVIPSONE is built from the ground up for use of outline fonts in Type 1 format.
Support for scalable fonts is _not_ an add-on to a basically bitmap-font
oriented design.

Special Features of DVIPSONE:
-----------------------------

*	DVIPSONE uses partial font downloading for fonts in Adobe Type 1
	format to greatly reduce the PostScript file size, the time to
	print, and use of printer virtual memory.  This is particularly
	important when using TeX, since TeX likes to use many fonts.

*	The output produced by DVIPSONE is resolution-independent --- 
	it can be sent, without alteration, to any PostScript device --- 
	high-resolution imagesetter as well as low-resolution laser printer.  

*	Output from DVIPSONE is `page-independent'.  Pages can be arbitrarily
	permuted, and pages can be removed without affecting the integrity of
	the PostScript print job.  Important for page imposition software!

*	DVIPSONE is unique in providing for `on-the-fly' reencoding of
	outline fonts.  This makes it possible to rearrange the character
	set layout and also to make unencoded characters accessible.

*	DVIPSONE can use the Computer Modern outline fonts, printer
	resident fonts, any of over 1,700 fonts Adobe font library --- 
	in fact, any of over 15,000 fonts now available in Type 1 format. 

*	DVIPSONE supports the ten most popular schemes for inclusion of
	illustrations in Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) form. 

*	There is no approximation of coordinates 
	(such as rounding to the nearest device pixel position) 
	in DVIPSONE's output, so positioning of characters and rules 
	will be as accurate as the output device allows.

*	DVIPSONE can use Type 1 fonts in Printer Font Binary (PFB) form,
	Printer Font ASCII (PFA) form, or even MacIntosh font file format
	(It is even possible to use bitmapped fonts with DVIPSONE).

*	DVIPSONE itself is fast, and the PostScript output it produces
	is concise, and executes rapidly in the printer. 

*	DVIPSONE supports TPIC \specials for device independent graphics.

*	Normally DVIPSONE does not require font metric files, since it
	obtains metric information directly from the outline font file.
	If the font file is missing, it can use TeX font metric files (TFM),
	Adobe font metric file (AFM), or even MicroSoft Windows font metric
	files (PFM) to adjust the font metrics of a replacement font.

*	A service bureau printing PostScript files produced by DVIPSONE
	need not be knowledgeable about TeX or DVI files.

*	A service bureau printing PostScript files produced by DVIPSONE 
	need not have access to high resolution bitmap fonts.

Standardization and Additional Capabilities:
--------------------------------------------

DVIPSONE meets or exceeds the requirements of the `Level 0' standard for DVI
drivers (announced by the TUG DVI driver standards committee) --- except, of
course, that DVIPSONE does not normally use bit-mapped fonts!

Font substitution can be used to print a document calling for fonts that are
not available.  Printer resident fonts can be used, as can any Adobe Type 1
font in ATM compatible form.  Outline fonts can be remapped by DVIPSONE to
use different character encodings, as, for example, the encoding normally
employed by TeX in text fonts.  

A utility program supplied with DVIPSONE called AFMtoTFM can be used to
produce TeX font metric files (TFM), needed by TeX, from Adobe font metric
files (AFM).  Another utility called PKtoPS makes Adobe Type 3 fonts from TeX
bitmap fonts (PK files) --- in case a font is needed that is not yet
available in outline form.
