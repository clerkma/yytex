Installing and running the Y&Y TeX System in Windows 95/98      (win95.txt)
=============================================================================

The Y&Y TeX System can be installed in Windows 95 simply by following the
installation instructions.  Y&Y TeX itself runs as a console application.

ATM:  The Y&Y TeX System comes with fonts in Adobe Type 1 format.  
These fonts are installed when you install ATM 4.0.

PCL: If you use PCL printers (such as HP printers in PCL mode) check section (1).

TrueType: If you use TrueType fonts, make sure to check out item (T) below.

ATM 4.0 Deluxe for Windows 95: DVIWindo automatically activates fonts
installed with ATM 4.0  That is, it will properly display documents
independent of whether the fonts called for are currently active (However,
inactive fonts will not show up in the font list displayed by `Show Fonts'). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Known Windows 95/98 bugs and problems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(0) For general bug information about Windows 95 see `programs.txt' (and
    other *.txt files) in your Windows directory. 

(1) Some Windows 95/98 PCL printer drivers (such as the ones for HP and NEC
    printers and the ones from Microsoft) have problems, particularly when 
    it comes to reencoded fonts.  These manifest themselves as missing
    characters (particularly f-ligatures and en- and emdash) as well as 
    bad spacing.  Hence, if the printer also has a PostScript mode, use 
    the PS mode instead! 

    To check for this PCL printer driver problem, bring up some Type 1 font 
    (like Helvetica) in DVIWindo's `Show Font' from the `Font' menu.  Then 
    select `Print View' from the `Print' menu.  Check that f-ligatures are
    printing (top row of characters if you are using TeX 'n ANSI encoding).

    If the f-ligatures do *not* print, do the following:
 
    (i) If your HP printer driver supports `Enhanced PCL' in addition to
     `Standard PCL' then try `Enhanced PCL' (Start > Settings > Printers).

    (ii) Make sure you have at least ATM version 4.0.

    (iii) In ATM 4.0 (Start > Programs > Adobe > ATM), select `Advanced' 
    from the `Settings' tab, and  check `Print Fonts as Graphics'.

    If this does not help, uncheck this checkbox again. Next,
    prevent the printer driver from using `soft fonts' or doing 
    its own rasterization.  The details will depend on the specific 
    printer driver you are using.  First try the following:

    From `Start' select `Settings' and then `Printers'.  In the
    resulting window select the printer in question and then select 
    from the `Printers' menu the `Properties' item.  Now step through 
    the property sheets.

    (iv) In the `Fonts' sheet, try checking `Print TrueType fonts 
    as bitmaps.'  If this does not help, continue.

    It is recommended that you use the printer driver's TrueType font 
    option to download TrueType fonts as bitmaps.  Details for the 
    driver's Properties dialog is presented below: 

    LaserJet III - Fonts tab, TrueType fonts section: 
    Select the "Download TrueType fonts as bitmap soft fonts" option.

    LaserJet 4 - Fonts tab, TrueType fonts section: 
    Select the "Download TrueType fonts as bitmap soft fonts" option.

    LaserJet 5 - Print Quality tab, Text Mode section: 
    Select the "TrueType as Bitmaps"  option.

    (v) In `Document Properties > Advanced > Document Options' 
    check `Print Text as Graphics'.  Your printer driver may not 
    have such a check box (or it may have different label).

    If you still have problems, we recommend trying the 
    "Print TrueType as Graphics" option (if your driver has one). 

    (vi) Or, if your printer driver does not have such a check box, 
    check instead `Image full page as graphic' in the `Image Control' pane
    (or something equivalent --- details depend on specific printer).

    Raster vs. Vector Mode - You may get more consistent results if your
    printer driver is set to use Raster mode for graphics. Not all
    printer drivers have this mode.

    (vii) The newest PCL drivers from HP seem to work a bit better.
    Check the dates on your driver files.  You may want to try the new
    HP LJ 5 drivers, even if you have a different model HP printer.

    You can download the latest Microsoft PCL drivers from
    http://support.microsoft.com/support/windows/drivers.asp

    You can download the latest HP printer drivers from http://www.hp.com,
    (more specifically http://www.hp.com/cposupport/eschome.html).

    Desperate measures:  

        (i)  Avoid f-ligatures by using Windows ANSI (ansinew) encoding.  

        (ii) Suppress f-ligatures in TeX using -2 on the command line
             (In DVIWindo "Preferences > Command Line > Y&Y TeX").

(2) In some rare cases, ATM installation may lead to a conflict with a 
     video driver.  If Windows 95 will not boot properly after installing
     ATM, then boot in `safe mode' (or VGA mode), install ATM and reboot.
     Finally, switch back to your favorite high resolution display mode.

(3) In some cases, ATM will not install when a virus checker is active,
     particularly Norton Anti-Virus.  Disable it before installation.

(4) If you are using the Adobe PS printer driver, do not use the one
    that ships with Pagemaker 6.0 - it does not work with Windows 95.
    You can use AdobePS driver 4.1 that ships with the `Enhancement Pack'
    or the one that comes with `ATM 4.0 Deluxe.'

(5) WinFax cannot handle reencoded Type 1 fonts either.  Use the MicroSoft 
    Windows Fax driver instead.  It works correctly.

(6) In Windows 95, files with long file names on FAT file systems have
    corrresponding abbreviated DOS names that include tilde (~, char 126).
    For example the file c:\My_TeX_Files\book.tex  might have a DOS file name
    like c:\mytexf~1\book.tex.  This is a problem, since TeX itself
    interprets the command line, tilde is `active,' and is translated to
    `space' --- thus in effect truncating the file name (this is similar to
    the problem with backslash in file names on the TeX command line, which
    TeX also tries to interpret).  Y&Y TeX has a built-in work-around for
    such shortened file names.

    HOWEVER: avoid names with spaces in them, since TeX parses the command
    line and assumes that white space indicates the end of the file name.
    If you do want to experiment despite this warning, remember to quote any
    file name containing space characters, e.g. "c:\My Book\chapter1.tex" 
    and remember that the quotes will be lost when you pass arguments 
    through a batch file.

(7) Trouble printing from the command prompt:  You should be able to
    use the COPY command on a PS file to ship it to your printer. E.g.

    COPY c:\yandy\dvipsone\debug\printst1.ps LPT1:

     If this yields something like a `permission denied' error
     then you will not be able to print using DVIPSONE.  This error
     may be the result of a `print monitor' that is hogging the 
     printer port.  Check your win.ini file for run=... entries
     that load up `printer monitors' and remove them - restart Windows.

     You may also need to go into `Start > Settings > Control Panel >
     Printers' to select the printer in question and click on
     `Properties' from the `Printer' menu.  Then in the `Details'
     property sheet click on `Port Settings' and check the `Spool
     MS-DOS print jobs' check box.

     In many cases DVIWindo can figure out the mapping between 
     `fake port names' like Ne01: or Hp01: and corresponding UNCs
     or share names like \\Group\\hp.

     If you are dealing with a network printer you may need to
     determine its UNC or `share name'.  Ask your network system
     administrator (sometimes this information can also be found
     in win.ini).  

     If the above fails to solve the problem, set things up to print
     to file and then ship the PS file to the printer.  This can
     be done using some Windows PS printer spooler program.
     On some networks the system is already setup so that the context
     menu you get when right-clicking on a PS file includes a 
     `Print' option.  Otherwise you may have to download a shareware
     print spooler.

     Also, HP printer installation may install a "toolbox" that is meant to
     ease the management of printer options.  This toolbox monitors LPT1 and 
     caused the conflict with any console application trying to write to LPT1
     Delete this `toolsbox' to solve the problem.

     A (green) printer icon in the task bar in Windows 95 indicates that the
     HP Toolbox is currently running.  CTR-ALT-DEL displays the programs that
     are currently running.  Search this list for a program that begins with
     HP (it's something like HPPROPTY).  End this task.  (The green icon  
     disappears.) This should resolve the printing problem.  If it does, you
     want to permanently remove this program from the system.  (This program
     is basically a short-cut to some of HP's functions but removing it does
     not reduce functionality.)  To remove the "toolbox", look for this
     program in the system folder of Windows 95.  (The file name is a
     shortened version of "HP Property".  It is an exe file.)  Delete this
     program in the system folder and in the trash can.  That's all there is
     to it.

     Finally, check your autoexec.bat for c:\explorer.4pl\status\stat4PL
     Comment this out (using REM at the start of the line) and reboot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
DOS Problems in Windows 95 (`Incorrect DOS Version' error messages):
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The DOS under Windows 95 is DOS version 7.0. If you installed on top of an
older version of DOS, and your PATH is not set up correctly, you may get
`Incorrect DOS Version' errors (e.g. while installation Y&Y TeX).

Your path should list c:\windows\command (new DOS directory) first, before
c:\dos (your old DOS directory) otherwise XCOPY and FIND will not work.  
In addition, the PATH can also list the old DOS directory, so that other DOS
commands like REPLACE will work (since they may not be defined in the new
version).  A typical PATH definition for AUTOEXEC.BAT might be:

    PATH c:\windows;c:\windows\command;c:\dos;c:\utility


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Inactive DOS boxes in Windows 95:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the DOS boxes in which YandYTeX, DVIPSONE, or AFMtoTFM are running do not
close automatically after these programs finish, click on the title bar with
the *right* mouse button, select `Properties,' and check `Close on Exit'.
Then click the `Close' icon (cross in top right corner of Window).  The new
setting will be used when the program is called again.  

Note that Windows 95 no longer has a separate PIF editor.  You can create
and/or edit a PIF file for a batch file (or DOS program) by right clicking on
it and selecting `Properties.'

******************************************************************************
    NOTE: Read the following if you use TrueType fonts.
******************************************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(T) Installing and Deleting TrueType Fonts in Windows 95:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can install TrueType fonts simply by dragging them to the \fonts
subfolder of your windows folder.  To uninstall a TrueType font drag
if from the \fonts folder to the `Recycle Bin.'  Use Windows Explorer.
Alternatively you can also open the `fonts' subfolder in the `windows' 
folder and select `File > Install Font',

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Font file name changes when TrueType fonts are `re-installed'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before installing a new version of a TrueType font, make sure to *uninstall*
and *remove* the corresponding font file (TTF).  Otherwise you may end up
with several copies of the font file with slightly different names.  Windows
95 automatically extends the font name with underscores and modifies the last
letter to create a new unique font file name.

For example, if you install LBMS several times without removing old copies
you end up with: lbms.ttf, lbms___0.ttf, lbms___2.ttf, etc.  This wastes
disk space and breaks the fixed relationship between font and font file name.

DVIWindo tries to deal with this problem when searching for fonts --- as well
as when you use WriteTFM, WriteAFM.  It always does find the correct font 
if there is at least one underscore between the original font file name and
the `version number' added at the end. If the original font file name is
already 7 or 8 characters long, however, and there are several fonts with
similar names, then this ambiguity cannot be resolved.  

The best solution is to avoid having more than one font file for a given font. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mismatch in TrueType font full name list:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DVIWindo will warn you if the TrueType font list enumerated by Windows does
not match the information in the registry.  The font names alluded to are 
supposed to be the `Full Names' of TrueType fonts.  There are three problem 
scenarios:

(1) Windows 95  Name error in TT font (Probably in Windows 95).
        Create a `ttfonts.reg' file (see below) or use the SETUPTTF
        utility to add [TTFonts] to WIN.INI, use setupttf -vfnm.

This should not happen unless you have a font installed under the wrong name
(or you have an older version of DVIWindo).  Check the names in the registry.

(2) Windows NT  Name error in TT font (Probably auto-converted T1 font).
        Move TTF and FOT files to empty directory,
        `Remove' font; then `Add...' using `Fonts' in Control Panel

This is typically due to a bug in the T1 to TT converter in Windows NT 3.51. 
Fonts are initially installed under the wrong name (FontName, not FullName).

(3) Windows 3.1 Name error in TT font (Windows 3.1).
        [Fonts] section of WIN.INI inconsistent, use setupttf -vfnm

This happens if WIN.INI does not list all TrueType fonts, or if the names do
not match those supplied by Windows (This can happen, for example, if the
names in WIN.INI are not the English names of the fonts).  Or if some
application (such as `Equation Lite') installs fonts under the wrong name
(such as the file name instead of the actual font name). 

SOLUTION:  In each case, run the setupttf supplied in the \util subfolder.

    setupttf -vfnm.

NOTE:   You can turn off these warning messages by adding  IgnoreBadInstall=1
    to the [Window] section of dviwindo.ini.

Additional Notes:
-----------------

In Windows 95, information on TrueType fonts is stored in the registry.
If you want to check the names of all installed TrueType fonts:

     Launch the registration data base editor (Click on `Start', select
    `Run,' type `regedit' and hit the Enter key).  Navigate down to:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Fonts

    This shows the installed TrueType fonts. You can write out this branch 
    of the registration data base into a file called `ttfonts.reg' in your
    Windows directory by selecting `Registry|Export Registry File.'  
    This is a plain ASCII file you can then inspect using any editor.
    (DVIWindo can use such a file, and may in fact already have forced
    RegEdit to write it).

In Windows NT font information is stored in the registry, but fortunately
Windows NT *also* pretends that they are listed in WIN.INI (for older
applications).  In Windows NT the registry editor is called REGEDT32.EXE.
