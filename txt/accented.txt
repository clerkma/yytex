Accented Characters in Computer Modern outline fonts from Y&Y:
=================================================================

The Computer Modern outline fonts from Y&Y contain 58 composite (accented)
characters in addition to the 128 characters normally expected.

The accented characters available are the 58 standard ones found in
Adobe fonts - these are the ones needed for the ISO Latin 1 character
set and for the MacIntosh character set (see AFM files for listing).

The composite characters do not appear in the encoding vectors (otherwise
these fonts couldn't be called Computer Modern fonts!).  To use the
extra characters, the font has to be reencoded (and should be renamed).

A font can be reencoded using the utility REENCODE supplied with the fonts.
REENCODE needs an encoding vector file specifying the mapping from
numeric character code to character name.  To specify, for example,
that character code 65 stands for upper case `A', the file could
contain the line `65 A'.  For examples, see files with extension `vec'.

Another way to change the encoding of a Printer font binary (PFB) file is 
to first convert it to Printer font ASCII (PFA) format using PFBtoPFA
(your font set may already be in PFA format) and then editing the file.

The lines following the line `/Encoding 256 array def' can be freely 
edited in the PFA file, since it contains only alphanumeric characters.  
(Never try to edit a PFB file directly - it contains binary length 
fields so it will no longer work correctly if the length of some section 
of the file changes.)  The PFA file can be turned back into a PFB file using
PFAtoPFB.  PFBtoPFA and PFAtoPFB are supplied with the CM fonts. 

For use with Display PostScript you may also want reencode the AFM
file. The utility REENCODE can do this, or you can just edit the AFM
file directly.

Turning the PFB file into a PFA file is useful also when the name of a font
is to be changed.  Change the /FontName, and the /FullName (and possibly the
/FamilyName) fields.  Also change the name in the first line of the font
(this is only a comment, but it is confusing if the name here is different
from the actual /FontName).  And change the name of the file, as desired. 

When a font has been reencoded, a new TeX font metric (TFM) file will
need to be created from the Adobe font metric (AFM) file using AFMtoTFM.
Specify the same encoding vector when using AFMtoTFM as that used to
reencode the font (AFMtoTFM is supplied with DVIPSONE and DVIWindo).

For use with Windows, a new Printer font metric (PFM) file will have
to created also using AFMtoPFM.  Specify the same encoding vector when
using AFMtoPFM as that used to reencode the font.  (AFMtoPFM is
supplied with DVIWindo).

Appendix:
=========

Due to a `mis-features' of many PostScript interpreters, 
there are some restrictions on how to reencode a font:

(*) The base and accent characters must to be in the encoding of the
    font - at least on most `non-clone' PS interpreters (such as ALW II NT).
    Otherwise one gets an `invalidfont' error.  
    Most `clones' (such as NewGen Turbo 480) don't have this problem.
    This means the encoding chosen should contain the accents:
    grave, acute, dieresis, cedilla, ring, caron, circumflex, and tilde,
    and the base characters:  A, C, E, I, N, O, S, U, Y, Z, 
    a, c, e, dotlessi, n, o, s, u, y, and z. 

(*) Annoyingly, with some PS interpreters the accents (and base characters)
    must be in predefined positions.  This is mostly only a problem with
    ATM for MS Windows, where for ATM 2.5 or earlier:

    grave, acute, dieresis, cedilla, ring, macron must be in ANSI positions;
    dotlessi, circumflex, tilde must be in specially defined ATM positions;
    caron, breve, hungarumlaut, ogonek (if used) must be in their 
    StandardEncoding positions;

    while for ATM 2.6 or later they must be in StandardEncoding position.

    See the file `texansi.vec' for a sample encoding that will work with
    printer PostScript interpreters as well as ATM for MS Windows.
