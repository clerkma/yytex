Using release 1.2 of the Y&Y TeX System in Windows 95		(win95old.txt)
==============================================================================

NOTE:	If you just received the Y&Y TeX system, then just install it.

The Y&Y TeX System can be installed in Windows 95 simply by following the
installation instruction sheet.  Y&Y TeX itself runs `native' in Windows 95
(without using the TNT DOS extender) - so it loads even faster than before!

The Y&Y TeX System comes with fonts in Adobe Type 1 format.  These work as
soon as you install Adobe Type Manager in Windows 95.  If you plan to also
use TrueType fonts, then go to step (T):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Knows Windows 95 bugs and problems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(0) For general Windows 95 info: see `programs.txt' in your Windows directory.

(1) ATM 3.01 may have problems using `soft fonts' when printing to PCL printers
    under Windows 95.  Contact Adobe for information on how to deal with this. 

(2) WinFax Pro 4.0 appears to have a problem with Type 1 fonts in Windows 95.
    See `programs.txt' in your Windows directory for more info.
    Note that the MicroSoft Windows 95 fax driver does support ATM fonts.

(3) The SysSeg utility will not show useful information in Windows 95
    (Type Alt-F4 to get rid of it if you started it inadvertendly).
    Use `Fonts|System Info' instead to get system information.

(4) Ini TeX refers to the `string pool' file as `tex.pool'.  In a FAT file
    system this gets truncated to `tex.poo'.  Long file names are supported
    under Windows 95, so ini TeX may complain about not being able to find
    `tex.pool' (which is in the `fmt' sub-directory of your yandytex
    directory).  In this case, just ask TeX to truncate names to the DOS 8+3
    convention by using -8 on the command line.  For convenience, the -8 can
    be added to batch files (tex.bat and initex.bat) that you use to call TeX
    or add a line TeX=-8 to the [Window] section of `dviwindi.ini' in the
    Windows directory.

(5) Files with long file names have abbreviated DOS names that include 
    character 126 (~).  For example c:\My TeX Files\book.tex might have
    a DOS file name like c:\mytexf~1\book.tex.  This is a problem, since TeX
    interprets the command line, and since this character is `active' and
    translated to `space' --- thus truncating the file name.
    Some work around will be provided in a future release of Y&Y TeX itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
DOS Problems in Windows 95 (`Incorrect DOS Version' error messages):
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The DOS under Windows 95 is DOS version 7.0. If you installed on top of an
older version of DOS, and your PATH is not set up correctly, you may get
`Incorrect DOS Version' errors (while installation Y&Y TeX for example).

Your path should list \windows\command (the new DOS directory) first, before
\dos (the old DOS directory) otherwise XCOPY and FIND will not work.  In
addition, the PATH should list both the new DOS directory and the old DOS
directory, otherwise other DOS commands like REPLACE will not work (since
they are not defined in the new directory).  A typical PATH definition for
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file might be:

	PATH c:\windows;c:\windows\command;c:\dos;c:\utility...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Inactive DOS boxes in Windows 95:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the DOS box in which YandYTeX, DVIPSONE, or AFMtoTFM are running do not 
close automatically after these programs run to completion, click on the
title bar with the *right* mouse button, select `Properties,' and check
`Close on Exit'.  Then click the `Close' icon (cross in top right corner of
Window).  The new setting will be remembered for the next time the program is
called. 

NOTE: If you don't use TrueType fonts you can *also* ignore the rest of this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switching to Windows 95 *after* installing the Y&Y TeX System on Windows 3.1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Re-install Adobe Type Manager (ATM) in Windows 95.

*	ATM *cannot* be installed under Windows 95 simply by copying files.
	You need at least ATM 3.01 for Windows 95. Earlier versions won't run.
	Ask Adobe for upgrade information (you did send in the ATM
	registration card right?).

(2) Find out what your Windows directory is:

    To find out what the `Windows' directory is, go into a DOS box, type SET
    and hit <Enter>.  Look for the value of the environment variable `windir.'

    If you installed Windows 95 on top of a dual-boot DOS/Windows NT setup,
    then Windows 95 will not install into the default Windows directory
    c:\windows, but somewhere else, e.g. c:\windows.000  If the Windows
    directory under Windows 95 is not the same as it was under Windows 3.1,
    then copy the old `dviwindo.ini' file to the new Windows directory. 
    Also copy any PIF files you may have for tex, dvipsone, afmtotfm etc.

(3a) Re-install DVIWindo from the diskette, *or*

(3b) create a new icon for DVIWindo in Windows 95, using the old copy 
     already installed under Windows 3.1.  But make *sure* DVIWindo can 
     find `dviwindo.ini' -- it must be in the new Windows directory.

............................................................................

WARNING: if you do not copy the old dviwindo.ini file to the new Windows
	 directory, and you have no fonts installed, then DVIWindo may 
	 give you a GPF (ugh!) when you try to open a DVI file. Check that:

     (i)   `dviwindo.ini' is in the Windows directory, 
     (ii)  `dviwindo.ini' has an [Environment] section, 
     (iii) the environment variable TEXFONTS is defined,
     (iv)  the TEXFONTS env var points to where your TFM files are, 
     (v)   one of the TEXFONTS directories has a file called `texfonts.map'
	   (which is put their by installation of Y&Y TeX itself). 

............................................................................

(4a) If you are using fonts in Adobe Type 1 format (a.k.a `PostScript'
     fonts), make sure that ATM is installed, *and* knows about the fonts 
     you have (go in ATM control panel to check what fonts it knows about).
     Reinstall the fonts if ATM did not pick them up automatically.  You can 
     `install' the fonts from the PFM sub-directory of the PSFONTS directory

(4b) If you are using TrueType fonts see section (T) below.

In either case, check font installation using `Font|Show Fonts' in DVIWindo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(T)		TrueType fonts and older versions of DVIWINDO:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:	You can ignore this section if you use only fonts in Type 1 format!

NOTE:	You can ignore this section if your `dviwindo.exe' has a date of
	1995/Aug/24 (Windows 95 release) or later (release 1.2.6).
	Check in `File|About' for full pedigree of your `dviwindo.exe.'

If it is older, read on.  Things have changed regarding TrueType font handling:

(1) Windows 95, does a really silly thing with the list of installed TrueType
    fonts when it is launched:  It reads the entries in the [fonts] section
    of `win.ini,' copies the information to the registry, and then
    *deletes* the entries in the [fonts] section of win.ini!

   Which wouldn't be so bad, if Windows 3.1 programs running in Windows 95
   could get at the relevant part of the registry!  And that in turn 
   wouldn't be so bad if Windows 95 redirected `GetProfileString' calls to 
   use the registry (as is done in Windows NT)!  For work-around see below.

(2) TrueType fonts are in the `fonts' sub-directory of the Windows directory,
    *not* the `system' sub-directory --- as in Windows 3.1 and Windows NT. 

(3) TrueType fonts now consist of just one file, the TTF file --- 
    the FOT files used in Windows 3.1 and Windows NT are gone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Installing and Deleting TrueType Fonts in Windows 95:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Click on `Start', select `Settings', select `Control Panel.'
Then in `Control Panel,' double click `Fonts'.  Then:

To *install* new TrueType fonts use `File|Install New Fonts'

To *delete* fonts, select the fonts using the mouse, and then use `File|Delete'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Font file name changes when TrueType fonts are `re-installed'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before installing a new version of a TrueType font, make sure to *remove*
the old one --- including the corresponding font file (TTF).  Otherwise you
may end up with several copies of the font file with slightly different
names.  Windows 95 automatically extends the font name with underscores
and modifies the last letter to create a new unique font file name.

For example, if you install LBMS several times without removing old 
copies you may end up with: lbms.ttf, lbms___0.ttf, lbms___2.ttf, etc.
This breaks the fixed relationship between font and font file name.

DVIWindo tries to deal with this problem when searching for fonts, as well 
as when you use WriteTFM, WriteAFM.  It always finds the correct font if
there is at least one underscore between the original font file name and
the `version number' added at the end. If the original font file name is
already 7 or 8 characters long and there are several fonts with similar
names, then this algorithm may fail.  The best solution is to avoid having
more than one font file for a given font (this also saves disk space!).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Older versions of DVIWindo complain about being unable to find TrueType fonts:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DVIWindo release 1.2.6 (dated 1995/August/24 or later) can access the hidden
font information in Windows 95.  Earliers versions may or may not, so read on.

As a result of the `mis-feature' of Windows 95 described above, you may find
that DVIWindo gives you error messages when you try to view DVI files calling
for TrueType fonts (or when trying to display a file that calls for Type 1
fonts of which at least one is missing).  In this case, try the following
steps in sequence.  Stop when TrueType fonts start to work in DVIWindo.  
One quick check to see whether TrueType fonts are working properly is to
check whether the `DVI Help' file can be opened in DVIWindo without error.

(A) Launch the registration data base editor (Click on `Start', select
    `Run,' type `regedit' and hit the Enter key).  Navigate down to:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Fonts

    This shows the installed TrueType fonts. Write out this branch of the
    registration data base into a file called `ttfonts.reg' in your Windows
    directory by selecting `Registry|Export Registry File.' 

    This will work in recent versions of DVIWindo (release 1.2.5 or later).  
    You have to repeat this procedure when you install additional TT fonts.

(B) If the above fails to solve the problem, run the utility SETUPTTF to 
    add the missing TrueType font entries to a [TTFonts] section of WIN.INI.

	setupttf -vfmn

	-f  get font names from TTF files instead of FOT files
	-m  add missing TrueType font entries to win.ini
	-n  create a [TTFonts] section instead of using the [Fonts] section.

    This will work in recent versions of DVIWindo (release 1.2.4 or later).
    DVIWindo has been modified to look in both [Fonts] and [TTFonts].
    You have to repeat this procedure when you install additional TT fonts.

(C) If the above fails to solve the problem, run the utility SETUPTTF without
    the -n command line flag to add entries to the [Fonts] section instead:

	setupttf -vfm

    This command has to be run every time you launch Windows 95 
    (since Windows 95 deletes the [Fonts] entries again!)

If your SETUPTTF does not appear to be adding the list of TrueType fonts to
the [TTFonts] or [Fonts] sections of WIN.INI, then you may need to explicitly
give it the list of TrueType fonts on the command line.  For example:

	setupttf -vfmn c:\windows\fonts\*.ttf

If your copy of SETUPTTF doesn't understand the command line flags given
in the above examples, then please contact us for the latest version.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Mismatch in TrueType font full name list:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will be warned if the TrueType font list enumerated by Windows does not
match the [Font] information in WIN.INI --- or the registry.  These latter
names are supposed to be the `Full Names' of the TrueType fonts.  There are
three cases to consider:

Windows 95	Name error in TT font (Probably in Windows 95).
		Run SETUPTTF utility to add [TTFonts] to WIN.INI,
		Use setupttf -vfnm

This is the result of Windows 95 removing the [Fonts] information.  See above.

Windows NT	Name error in TT font (Probably auto-converted T1 font).
		Move FOT and TTF files to empty directory,
		`Remove' font; then `Add...' using `Fonts' in Control Panel

This is typically due to a bug in the T1 to TT converter in Windows NT 3.51.  
The fonts are installed under the wrong name.  Reinstall the TTF & FOT files.

Windows 3.1	Name error in TT font (Windows 3.1).
		[Fonts] section of WIN.INI inconsistent,
		Use setupttf -vfnm

This happens if WIN.INI does not list all TrueType fonts, or if the names
there do not match those supplied by Windows.  The latter can happen if
the names in WIN.INI are not the English names of the fonts. Run SETUPTTF.
