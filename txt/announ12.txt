		Upgrade for Y&Y TeX System now available:
=========================================================================

Upgrade to release 1.2 of the Y&Y TeX System (from release 1.1).  What's new?

	And they said it couldn't be done:  

		Full on-the-fly font reencoding in Windows!

Make unencoded glyphs accessible --- even design your own character layout.
You can now easily access all 228 glyphs in typical text fonts, even the 
15 not in Windows ANSI encoding (such as fi, fl, dotlessi, dotaccent, ring,
caron etc)!  All without making permanent modifications to your font files.
Just install your Type 1 fonts straight off the font diskette using ATM.

	Don't have AFM (Adobe Font Metric) files for your fonts?  
	No problem:  the previewer can now create AFM files complete with 
	accurate character bounding boxes - even for unencoded characters!

You can make TFM files for all installed fonts straight from the previewer.
So should you desire, it is easy to change text font encoding: 
simply change the ENCODING environment variable and create new TFM files.

We have even designed a new encoding vector (TeX n ANSI) that best exploits
the new capabilities --- making it easy to use plain TeX, AMS TeX,
LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX 2e with the same text font encoding scheme.

You can use accented characters directly in your source file, or link to them
automatically using pseudo ligatures.  Either way, using the pre-built
accented characters makes it possible to properly hyphenate words containing
accents.  Y&Y TeX provides extensive support for `foreign' keyboard and code
pages using command line configurable input translation tables.

The previewer and printer driver now verify font encoding wired into a TFM
file.  You get a warning if the DVI file was made using TFM files set up for
a different text font encoding than the one currently selected (mismatches
in TFM file encoding can lead to insiduous bugs when printing).

Multiple Master fonts can now be used in TeX.  Both previewer and printer
driver provide support for Multiple Master font instances (Note: You need 
ATM 3.0 or later to create new Multiple Master font instances).

The previewer now supports placeable Windows MetaFile (WMF) images as well
as TIFF images and EPS files with preview.

Hyper-text `buttons' can now be used not only to link to `markers' 
in a DVI file, but to launch other DOS or Windows applications.  
Such `buttons' can also now be used to link to other DVI files. 

The search capability in DVI files works even when words contain
fi and fl ligatures.

Previewer and printer driver now support a second scheme for both rgb and
cmyk color.   This provides compatibility with other implementations.

The previewer now supports `hidden' rules and text that only show up in
preview.  Useful for marking important dimensions --- or making annotations
in your document --- without danger of the marks ever appearing in print.
Particularly nice if done in color.

Menu items allow you to `Revert to Factory Defaults', `Show System Info' etc.

Many other exiting new features and improvements.  Also:

*  TeX formats and style files for the latest patch level of LaTeX 2e included.

*  Help file for previewer using hypertext linkages included.

And remember:

******************************************************************************
*    The new Y&Y TeX system is the *only* TeX implementation that provides   *
*    for arbitrary text font encoding while supporting ATM for preview.      *
*    This includes the ability to make unencoded characters accessible!      *
******************************************************************************

The upgrade is free if you purchased the Y&Y TeX System after 1995/Jan/31.

The upgrade from 1.1 is $58 (plus shipping) until 1995/July/31.

The upgrade from 1.0 or earlier is $98 (plus shipping) until 1995/July/31.

The new Lucida Bright Expert font set complements the basic Lucida Bright +
Lucida New Math font set.  It adds small caps, bold math, upright regular
and bold math, seriffed typewriter fonts, non-connecting `handwriting' fonts
and more.  The sixteen new fonts in this set combine with the twenty-five in
the basic set to create a true `super family'.

	The `Notices of the American Mathematical Society' are now typeset
	using Lucida Bright + Lucida New Math along with Lucida Bright Expert.
