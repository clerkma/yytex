Fix for problems with auto converted T1 fonts in Windows NT	(t1instal.txt)
==========================================================================

NOTE: You can ignore this if you are using ATM 4.0 for Windows NT!

NOTE: In the case of CM and AMS fonts, this problem in NT has little effect.

The automatic conversion of Type 1 to TrueType in Windows NT is very handy,
but has several bugs (which we have reported to Microsoft).  For example, in
Windows NT 4.0, when you double click on an auto converted non-text font you
always get a display of the Wingdings font, not the font you selected.  Also,
fonts are installed under a mangled PS FontName instead of something useful
like the PS FullName.  Fortunately, these problems do not prevent one from
using converted fonts with TeX.

However, now that DVIWindo can reencode TrueType fonts on the fly, new
problems have surfaced with the automatic conversion, such as not converting
f-ligatures correctly (in real - i.e. non-CM - text fonts).  DVIWindo can use
f-ligatures in the fonts that come with Windows NT (like Arial, Courier New,
and Times New Roman), but f-ligatures are lost in auto-converted fonts.  
In addition, some less frequently used characters (such as hungarumlaut,
fraction, Zcaron, zcaron, Omega, Delta) are also dropped.  What is more,
fixed-width non-text fonts (such as CMTT* and CMTEX*) appear as text fonts
after conversion, and hence reencoded to Windows ANSI - with bad results!

Note that these problems mostly do NOT affect CM, extra LaTeX + SliTeX or AMS
fonts (except for the problem with fixed width fonts like CMTT* and CMTEX*).

Microsoft appears not to be planning further revisions or bug fixes in
T1INSTAL.DLL (and in any case we can't wait - even if they did plan on it).
So we have modified T1INSTAL.DLL ourselves.  If you install the modified
version, the above mentioned problems (and some others) will go away.

==================================================
Installing the new T1 => TT font for converter NT 
==================================================

(0) If you have Windows NT 4.0, check that the T1INSTAL.DLL in your
    c:\winnt\system32 folder is 117,520 bytes, dated 8-09-96.  
    If you have Windows NT 3.51, check that T1INSTAL.DLL in your
    c:\windows\system32 directory is 115,008 bytes, dated 5-26-95.
    If it is not, you have a different build of NT and this fix may 
    not work correctly.  If in doubt, run `showtabl.exe' - if it complains
    about bad pointers, then the fix we supply may not work on your system.
    You can try it, but make sure to keep a backup copy of your T1INSTAL.DLL.
    (Contact Y&Y in that case with details on build and service pack 
    number and info on your version of T1INSTAL.DLL).

(1) Make an `Emergency Repair Disk' (or update your current one).  We see no
    reason why you would need this, but it is always a good idea to have one.
    To do this, from `Help' select `Topics' and find `Emergency Repair Disk'

(2) If you have not yet installed Type 1 fonts skip this step.
    Create a new temporary folder to hold PFB/PFM files.  Call it 
    `myfonts' say.  You can create this on the desktop by right clicking 
    with the mouse and selecting `New'.  Putting uninstalled PFB and PFM 
    font files here rather than in the recycle bin will save you later 
    having to dig up the original font diskettes.

(3) If you have not yet installed Type 1 fonts skip this step.
    Uninstall all of your auto-converted fonts.  The easiest way in
    Windows NT 4.0 is to open Windows Explorer (from `Start > Programs') and
    navigate to c:\winnt\fonts.  You may want to select `List' or `Details'
    from the `View' menu to see both font names and file names listed.
    Drag the auto converted TT font files that you installed (and only
    those!) to the recycle bin.  You can tell which are auto-converted
    fonts since each TTF file will have companion PFB and PFM files with the
    same name.  Drag the corresponding PFB/PFM files to your temporary folder. 

    Do *not* simply delete font files from the fonts folder - if you do,
    orphaned entries in the registry will plague you later.  Also, in some 
    cases you may have to drag the files several times to uninstall them.
    If, after several tries, the font file is still in the font folder,
    reboot, the system may have it locked because it is `in use'.
    You may also get messages about not being able to find files.
    This can happen because the list of fonts shown in this folder 
    is based on what is in the registry and not the actual font files
    in the folder - and the registry can get `out of synch' with the folder.

    Just ignore these messages and keeping dragging font files that you
    installed out of the font folder.  Do not remove the TrueType fonts that
    came with Windows NT, such as Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman etc.
    However, you may have corresponding Type 1 fonts also installed.  These
    have names Helvetica, Courier, and Times Roman.  Uninstall these.

(3) Rename c:\winnt\system32\t1instal.dll 
    (or c:\windows\system32\t1instal.dll) t1instal.bak
    (If you experience problems with the modified DLL later, you can
    delete the modified one, rename t1instal.org again, and reboot).

(4) Copy the modified t1instal.dll into c:\winnt\system32 or 
    c:\windows\system32.  Use t1instal.dll from the winnt400 folder
    for Windows NT 4.0; use the one from the winnt351 folder for
    Windows NT 3.51.

(5) IMPORTANT: reboot.

(6) If you have previously installed fonts, reinstall them --- and auto
    convert --- the Type1 fonts.  Otherwise install the fonts direct from
    the original diskette (or temporary directory in the case of MathTime).
    In Windows NT 4.0 drag the PFM (not PFB) files from the temporary folder
    into the fonts folder.  Make sure to check all three check boxes in the
    dialog box that comes up.  The installer will automatically convert the
    PFB file with the same name as the PFM file you dragged.

(7) To check the result:  Open DVIWindo and select one of your fonts from
    `Fonts > Show Font'  If you are using TeX 'n ANSI encoding you should
    see fi and fl ligatures in the first row of characters.

===========================================
Some of the problems fixed in T1INSTAL.DLL:
===========================================

fi and fl ligatures where mapped to to the wrong place.

ff, ffi, ffl ligatures where dropped (if the font has them).

Zcaron and zcaron were dropped, even though in `standard' set of 228 glyphs

dotlessj dropped - now mapped (note: this is not standard)

hungarumlaut dropped because of spelling error (hungerumlaut)

various other typos traglf -> triaglf and aroowleft -> arrowleft

fraction was mapped to the wrong place

Omega was dropped because referred to as ohm - changed to Greek Omega

Delta treated as math increment - instead of Greek Delta

Fixed width non-text fonts (such as math or CMTT* and CMTEX*) lost the
`decorative/pi' label and so where treated as *text* fonts and remapped to
ANSI (To be precise: family FF-DECORATIVE was turned into FF_DONTCARE).

P.S. You can use showtabl.exe to check out the tables in both
the original and the modified T1INSTAL.DLL.
