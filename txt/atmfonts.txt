===================================================================
Having DVIPSONE automatically include fonts called for in EPS files
===================================================================

EPS files may include fonts, or may instead only include DSC (Document
Structuring Comments) requesting fonts.  Adobe Illustrator is one
program that uses DSC comments rather than actually including the fonts
required in the EPS files. These comments are aimed at a mystical
`spooling' program.  No spooling program gets into the act when
DVIPSONE creates a PS file, so DVIPSONE has to try and accomodate these
font requests itself (most DVI->PS processors do not do this, by the way).

The DSC comments of interest are of the form 

	%%IncludeResource: font ...  or the older style 
	%%IncludeFont: ... 

There are also 

	%%DocumentNeededResource: font ... or the older style
	%%DocumentNeededFonts: ... 

comments, but these are merely advisory and do not indicate where to
include the fonts (see Appendix G of the PS Reference Manual 2nd edition).

The name mentioned in DSC comment is the PS FontName (e.g. Times-Bold), 
*not* the name of the corresponding PFB file (e.g. tir_____.pfb).

Somehow DVIPSONE has to map from the PS FontName to the file name:

(1) DVIPSONE first looks in the font substitution file for entries tagged
*epsf* or *reside*.  The standard substitution file is `standard.sub.' 
A different substitution file can be specified on the command line.
Substitution files are found where the environment variable SUBPATH points
to, typically c:\yandy\dvipsone\sub.

(2) If DVIPSONE can find the ATMREG.ATM file (typically in the windows
directory), it uses the information in this compact binary file to relate PS
Fontname to the file name of the PFB file.  ATMREG.ATM is maintained by ATM
4.0 or higher, so is not available when using ATM 3.0, or in NT without ATM.

(3) If DVIPSONE can find an ATM.INI file it uses the information there.  The
ATM.INI file relates Windows Face Name and style (e.g. Times, BOLD) to the
file name.  Note that the Windows Face Name is often not the same as the PS
FontName (even taking into account the decoration with a style).  The 
ATM.INI file is maintained by ATM 3.0 and is not used in Windows NT.

To have DVIPSONE reliably obey DSC font inclusion request one
can add entries to the substitution file tagged *epsf* or
*reside* in the form

	lbr		LucidaBright			*epsf*
or
	tir		Times-Roman				*force* *reside*

Since the font substitution file is also used by DVIPSONE for other
purposes you may prefer instead to create an ATMFONTS.MAP file.

(4) An ATMFONTS.MAP file should be put where DVIPSONE looks for PFB font
files (typically c:\psfonts or c:\winnt\fonts).  The ATMFONTS.MAP file
contains `key=value' entries, where the `key' is the PS FontName and the
`value' is the PFB file name. For example:

	TektonMM=c:\psfonts\zjrg____.pfb

Printer resident fonts should not be included in the PS file, even when the
EPS files calls for them using DSC comments.  DVIPSONE consults
`standard.sub' (or another substitution file you ask for using command line
flags).  to determine what fonts are printer resident.  The default
substitution file lists the four styles each of Times, Helvetica, and
Courier.  You can add to this list if the EPS files calls for other fonts
that are resident in your printer.
