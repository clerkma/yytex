Tutorial

If you did not already do so during installation, this may be 
a good time to create a directory for {\TeX} source file
such as the one to be typed in this exercise.
You can create a new directory using the Windows File Manager.  

While you can ask {\TeX} to process files from anywhere in your system,
it is easier for {\TeX} to find files in this directory if it is on the list
of directories specified by the €TEXINPUTS€ environment variable.
Let's suppose you chose to call the directory €c:\texinput€.
Double click on the DVIWINDO.INI icon.  
This launches NotePad and reads €dviwindo.ini€ 
from the Windows directory.  
Look for a line starting €TEXINPUTS=€ in the €[Environment]€ section.
Add a semicolon (;) at the end of the list of directories,
and add the full path of the new directory.

Launch DVIWindo by double-clicking on the DVIWindo icon.
Select `TeX\vbar PFE Editor' to call the editor.  
You will be presented with a File Open dialog box.
Enter an exclamation mark (!) for `File Name' --- 
this tells the system that you do not wish to open an existing file.
Click `OK.'  The PFE editor comes up.
If it covers the full screen, change it to windowed mode by
clicking on the double arrow icon in the top right corner.
Select `File\vbar New.'  A window labelled `Untitled1' appears.

You may want to resize the overall PFE editor 
window to cover less of the screen 
(drag the right and bottom edges closer to the edges 
of the `Untitled1' window).
Then click on the window labelled `Untitled1' and type
something like `€Hello World!€,' 
followed by `€\end€'.
Select `File\vbar Save.'  
You will be presented with a `File Save' dialog box.
Navigate to the directory you wish to use for {\TeX} input files,
enter `hello.tex' for the File Name, and click `OK'.

Now that the file has been saved, 
click on DVIWindo's window. % to give it the input focus.
Select `TeX\vbar plain TeX'.
Use the File Open dialog box that appears to
select the file that you have just saved.
Y\&Y TeX will run in a Window that disappears when it finishes,
Now select `TeX\vbar Preview' to see the typeset result.
(If you don't see it right away, try `File\vbar Default Scale').

At this point click on the PFE window to get its attention again,
and add €$z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$€
before €\end€.
This time just type C-S to save the modified file.
Then click on DVIWindo's window again, and this time use the F5
function key to call plain {\TeX}.
The preview will be automatically refreshed
when {\TeX} has finished converting €hello.tex€ to €hello.dvi€.

You will notice how once you get going, there is less
need to interact with File Open dialog boxes.
Most things in the editor can be accomplished using the tool bar
instead of using the pull down menus.
And judicious use of `hot keys' in €DVIWindo€ greatly speeds 
the edit-{\TeX}-preview cycle.
