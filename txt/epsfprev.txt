Adding a preview to an EPS file that does not have one:
-------------------------------------------------------

DVIWindo shows previews in either TIFF or EPSI format in EPS files.
Most Windows graphics applications add a TIFF preview to EPS files.
Many Unix graphics applications add an EPSI format preview to EPS files.

If you have an EPS file without preview, you can add one using a commercial 
product such as `Transverter Pro' from `TechPool Software'
1463 Warrensville Center Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44121-2676 USA
(216) 291-1922 (voice) and (216) 382-1915 (fax)

Or you can use GhostScript 2.6.1 and GhostView 0.7 for Windows 
--- which is public domain, but much harder to install and use.
In GhostView select `Edit' from the menu, then select `Add EPS Preview'.
This adds a preview in TIFF format, which DVIWindo understands.

Or, use  ps2epsi.bat <infile.ps> <outfile.ps> in DOS.  Read ps2epsi.doc for
details.  This adds a preview in EPSI format, which DVIWindo also understands.

Or use pstoepsi available from ftp.cs.purdue.edu in the directory /pub/dgc

WARNING: It's a bit of work installing GhostView and GhostScript, the files
take up some space, and it may take a while to get it all working smoothly.
Also, you may have problems with some files that GhostScript cannot handle.

PC/Windows version of Ghostscript 2.6.1:
----------------------------------------

You need the files:

	gs261win.zip
	gs261ini.zip
	gs261386.zip	(or gs261286.zip if your machine is a 286)

You may NOT want to get the `gsf' fonts that go with this, in files

	gs22fnta.zip, gs22fntb.zip, ... gs22fne.zip

Use real Adobe Type 1 fonts instead.  Rename  fontmap.atm => fontmap. 
Rendering of Type 1 fonts will not be as good as with ATM, of course.

Look around for the ready-made PC versions of GhostScript.
One site is  ftp.ruf.uni-freiburg.de  in directory  pc/ghostscript.

For GhostView 0.7 beta:
-----------------------

You need the file:		gsview07.zip

One site is ftp.cs.wisc.edu  in directory pub/ghost.
Another is ftp.cica.inidiana.edu  in pub/pc/win3/util.

If you have trouble locating GhostScript or GhostView, try `archie.'
Potential sites include  oak.oakland.edu,  ftp.cs.wisc.edu,  
ftp.cica.inidiana.edu (and its mirrors), and prep.ai.mit.edu.

Avoid versions that need to be compiled, or are for other platforms.
Avoid versions that use other compression schemes than zip,
including tar format that has do be undone on Unix first.
