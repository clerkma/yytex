A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE NAMING of NON-CM FONTS USED IN TeX

Now that increasing use is being made of non-CM fonts in TeX, it is
important that standards be developed for the names used to refer
to such fonts in TeX input.  Without such a standard, TeX cannot
locate the appropriate font metric information, and DVI processing
programs connot locate the required font outlines or bitmaps, or
use the correct font name to invoke the correct printer-resident fonts.

This lack of codification has proved to be a major source of
frustration when DVI files are ported from one computer system
to another, as is common when publishing journal articles and
books from author-supplied material.  As it stands now, each
project to be run out requires customization, compelling
the typesetter to set up yet another new font name translation
table that maps names used in TeX to file names. And this usually
requires consulting with the author to determine just what
the font names in the manuscript mean.

Perhaps more seriously, without a uniform naming convention,
it may happen that the DVI processing program and TeX have
conflicting notions about what fonts are being referred to--
with disasterous consequences.  Without a naming convention
then, DVI files are not truly "device independent" since
they are tied to the naming convention used on a particular
computer system.

As a basis for our proposal, we quote from the "The TeXbook"
(p.278):

"The syntax for <file name> in

    	\font<control sequences><equals><file name><at clause>

is not standard in TeX because different operating systems
have different conventions.

You should ask your local system wizards for details on just
how they have decided to implement filenames.

However, the following principles should hold universally:

A <file name> should consist of <optional spaces> followed by
explicit character tokens (after expansion).

A sequence of six or fewer ordinary letters and/or digits
followed by a space should be a file name that works in
essentially the same way on all installations of TeX...."

Consequently:

*  We recommend that where a standard naming convention for a font
library already exists that fits into the scheme advocated in
"The TeXbook", then that convention should be adopted for use
with TeX and DVI converters.

Presently, many of the non-CM fonts called for by users of TeX are
PostScript outline fonts, either printer resident or in
downloadable form.  Adobe Systems was already inspired to invent
a naming convention for the fonts in their library for use on
computers that cannot handle long file names.

In their library, file names are assigned to fonts by (manually)
contracting the font family name and appending standard modifiers
for bold (b), italic (i), bold-italic (bi), light (l), oblique (o),
narrow (n), condensed (c), and so on.  Thus information about the
font with PostScript FontName 'Times-BoldItalic', for example, is
stored in files with the name 'tibi'.

An extension of the file name indicates what type of information
is in the file.  Commonly used extensions are .afm (for Adobe
font metric information), .tfm (for TeX font metric information),
.pfm (for MicroSoft Windows printer font metric information),
.pfb (for printer font binary), and .pfa (for printer font ASCII).

Adobe's Fontdownloader limits the file name to six characters,
which conforms exactly to the recommendation in "The TeXbook".
It seems logical then that:

*  When using Adobe PostScript outline fonts in TeX, one should
simply follow this naming convention.

(There is presently no conflict with CM font names since none of
the fonts in the Adobe font library have names starting with the
letters 'cm'.)

One possible complication arises from the practice of remapping
character codes in non-CM fonts to lie in positions that are used
by TeX in some CM font.  One should be able to distinguish between
a font that is used verbatim and one that has been remapped:

*  We recommend that the suffix 'm' be appended to a fontname when
a remapped version is intended.

This is not completely unambiguous since the font can be remapped
in different ways, but it will usually be obvious what is
intended.  Thus a regular font would normally be remapped to the
ordinary text (roman) encoding of TeX (as for cmr10), an italic
font would be remapped to TeX's italic encoding (as for cmti10),
while a symbol font would be remapped to TeX's symbol encoding
(as in cmsy10).

*  We recommend that the 'm' be used as a suffix, NOT as a prefix
so that related fonts continue to appear together in a sorted list.

(Adding the suffix to a name with six characters brings it to
seven, but even the most limiting file systems these days allow
up to eight characters.)

It should be noted that the issue of remapping is now becoming
less important as users are switching to TeX 3.0, which supports
fonts with 256 character codes.  But it seems likely that
continued used will be made of remapping for specialized purposes.

*  We also recommend that no prefix (e.g. 'ps') be attached to
fontnames since this wastes two precious characters out of the
six (or perhaps eight) that are available on some systems.
