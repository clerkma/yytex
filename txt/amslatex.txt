=======================================================================
	Creating a TeX `format' file for AMS-LaTeX (with LaTeX 2.09)
=======================================================================

USING LaTeX 2e:
---------------

The official word is that LaTeX 2.09 is no longer supported, so you may want
to use LaTeX 2e instead.  In LaTeX 2e, AMS-LaTeX is just another style.  
There is no need to build a new TeX `format'. Just use

	\usepackage{amsmath}

(NOT: \usepackage{amstex} --- that is for backward compatability only).

You need to download files from /tex-archive/macros/latex/packages/amslatex
for this to work, since these files are not part of the `basic' LaTeX 2e
distribution. 

Support for fonts other than Computer Modern in LaTeX 2e is still somewhat
in a state of flux.  So while AMS LaTeX 1.2 appears to work smoothly with
Computer Modern fonts, there may still be some wrinkles to work out with
other font set, such as MathTime or LucidaBright.  Please refer also to:

NOTE: If you use LaTeX 2e you don't need to read the rest of this file.

Reference Material for LaTeX 2.09:

The following book provides information on AMS-LaTeX in general:

Background:
----------

AMS-LaTeX provides the capabilities of AMS-TeX within the context of the
LaTeX environment.  The AMS-LaTeX macros are basically style files for LaTeX,
however, they do require the New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS). 

Support for NFSS in LaTeX 2.09 has been with-drawn :-{ -- 
although it is not clear exactly what that means, 
other than that bug reports will go unanswered, 
and that it may be hard to find the source files for NFSS 
(except perhaps on the black market :=).

Working with LaTEX 2.09 and NFSS:
---------------------------------

The AMS-LaTeX distribution includes three sub-directories:

	doc		AMS-LaTeX documents source files
	fontsel		New Font Selection Scheme
	latex		AMS LaTeX itself

Copy the files in `fontsel' and `latex' into your TEXINPUTS directory.
For example:

	copy b:\fontsel\*.* c:\texinput
	copy b:\latex\*.* c:\texinput

Where we have assumed that `c:\texinput' is a directory listed in your
TEXINPUTS environment variable.

We recommend that any non-trivial ini-TeX operation be run from the DOS 
command line instead of from DVIWindo.  That way you have better control
of the details.  Just call Y&YTeX with -i on the command line. For example:

	c:\y&ytex\y&ytex -i lplain

But you need to do some other things first:

*	rename `lfonts.tex' -> `olfonts.tex'
	(This is the file for the `Old Font Selection Scheme')

*	locate the new files, including `lfonts.new.'
	(This is the file for the `New Font Selection Scheme')

WARNING: Note that running ini-TeX will create a new `format' file called
`lplain.fmt' -- which is also what your old LaTeX format file is called!
So, to prevent your `lplain.fmt' from being overwritten, do not
run ini-TeX in your TEXFORMATS directory.  Either: 

	(i) temporarily rename your old `lplain.fmt', or 
	(ii) run ini-TeX in a temporary directory.

When you run ini-TeX as above you will get several complaints about missing
files (if you *don't* get any complaints, then you forgot to rename
`lfonts.tex' and you just created a format for `ordinary' LaTeX ;=).
Rather than edit the source files to fix this, it may be more convenient
to just tell TeX what file to use each time it complains about a missing
file.  Use the following replacement table: 

	File sought	Replacement

 	lfonts.tex	lfonts.new
	fontdef.tex	fontdef.mac
	preload.tex	preload.ori
	xxxlfont.sty	basefont.tex

At the end, when back at the * prompt in TeX, type \dump at TeX.

The resulting format file will be called `lplain.fmt,' which, as noted above,
is a problem since that is the name of the LaTeX format file!  To avoid
conflict, rename the new format file `amslatex.fmt' lets say.  Then move it
to your TEXFORMATS directory: 

	rename lplain.fmt amslatex.fmt
	move amslatex.fmt c:\y&ytex\fmt

As stated above, AMS-LaTeX is in a state of flux, since it depends on NFSS,
which is no longer supported outside of LaTeX 2e.  And in LaTeX 2e, AMS LaTeX
is simply a style file...
