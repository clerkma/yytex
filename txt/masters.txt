    Using Adobe Multiple Master Fonts with the Y&Y TeX System (95/Feb/1)
===============================================================================

Adobe Multiple Master fonts can be used with the Y&Y TeX System:

Multiple Master Instances:
--------------------------

Multiple Master fonts come with ready-made prime instances.  With ATM 3.0 
for Windows you can also create new instances of Multiple Master Fonts
(ATM 2.6 already had the ability to *rasterize* multiple master fonts ---
since that is needed by the Acrobat Reader --- but it did not include 
a control panel entry providing for *creation* of new instances*).

For additional details refer to `techref.wri' on the ATM 3.0 diskette.

Making TeX Font Metric (TFM) files for MM fonts:
-------------------------------------------------

For use with TeX you need a TFM file.  TFM files are created by AFMtoTFM.
However, AFMtoTFM cannot interpret Multiple Master Metric metric files, only
ordinary AFMs.  The solution is to create a suitable AFM file using DVIWIndo:

(*)	In DVIWindo, one can write an AFM file for any installed font by
	selecting `Write AFM...' from the `Font' menu.  For text fonts, select
	`ansinew' as the encoding.  When it is done, DVIWindo tells you where
	it wrote the AFM file, and what it is called.  Make a note of this
	information, since it will be needed later.

	The AFM file will normally be placed in your DVIWindo directory, and
	the file name will be the same as that of the corresponding PFM file.
	Use AFMtoTFM from a `DOS box' to create a TFM file and move it to
	where your TeX looks for TFM files (as specified by TEXFONTS).   
	For text fonts specify the command line arguments -vadjx -c=ansinew:

		afmtotfm -vadjx -c=ansinew myfont.afm
		copy myfont.tfm c:\y&ytex\tfm

(*)	In release 1.2 of the Y&Y TeX System, DVIWindo can also call AFMtoTFM
	directly.  Select `WriteTFM...' instead of `WriteAFM...'  For text
	fonts, the currently selected text font encoding will be use. This is
	determined by the value of the ENCODING env var in the [Environment]
	section of your `dviwindo.ini' file.  An intermediate AFM file is
	written in the AFM sub-directory of your DVIWINDO directory.  
	(Should there be any problems, you can inspect this file, and run
	AFMtoTFM `manually' on an edited version if needed). 

NOTE:	AFMtoTFM can make TFM files for math fonts, but *only* if the AFM
	file contains a lot of additional information needed by TeX.  This
	information *cannot* be obtained from the font itself in Windows.
	Always use the original TFM files supplied with math fonts. 

Alternative Method for Obtaining AFM files:
-------------------------------------------

An alternative, less desirable method for getting an AFM file is the following:

(*)	Each MM instance is represented by a PFM file containing the metrics,
	and a PSS file which contains some PostScript code linking to the
	base MM font. You can use PFMtoAFM to extract a metrics file in AFM
	format from the PFM file.  The resulting AFM file will be placed in
	the current directory by PFMtoAFM.  

	An AFM file created this way will not be as complete or accurate as
	an AFM file create with `AFMWrite...' since the PFM file format does
	not contain equivalent fields for all the fields in an AFM file ---
	but it is typically adequate for the purpose at hand. 

	Once you have the AFM file, use AFMtoTFM to create a suitable TFM
	file for TeX (select `ansinew' as the encoding).  Copy the TFM file
	to where your TeX expects to find TFM files (one of the directories
	listed in the TEXFONTS list of directories).

Printing with Multiple Master Fonts:
------------------------------------

You can print from DVIWindo using Multiple Master fonts.  This works for
non-PS printers as well as PostScript printers.  For non-PS printers ATM
does the rasterizing.  For PS printers, the PostScript stub file (PSS) is
downloaded, as well as the base MM font.

DVIPSONE now also downloads Multiple Master fonts.  If the DVI file calls 
for a Multiple Master instance, then DVIPSONE will expand the PSS stub.
It will also load the corresponding Multiple Master base font.  The base
font is, of course, included only once, even if several different instances
of the font are referred to.

Finding the PFM file corresponding to a particular instance:
-----------------------------------------------------------

When Acrobat creates a Multiple Master `instance' it creates a new PFM 
(Printer Font Metric) file for it and a new PSS (PostScript Stub) file.  
The base MM font is contained in a PFB file and its metrics in an MMM file,
The PFM files for the MM instances have file names that end in a three digit
number.  You can find out which PFM file corresponds to which MM instance by
looking in ATM.INI. You will find entries like:

TektoMM_240 RG 564 NO=c:\psfonts\pfm\zjrg_004.pfm,c:\psfonts\zjrg_004.pss

The Windows face name --- listed in font menus --- is the part before the `='
The first few letters give the base MM font name --- `TektoMM' in this case.
In the illustration here, the first axis (weight) is 240 and the RG denotes
Regular weight.  The second axis (width) is set to 564 and the NO indicates
Normal width. 

The corresponding PFM file may be found in c:\psfonts\pfm\zjrg_004.pfm.
The line also refers to the MM PostScript `stub' c:\psfonts\zjrg_004.pss
This defines the instance in terms of the base MM fonts which itself is
defined by the following entry in the ATM.INI file:

	TektoMM=c:\psfonts\pfm\zjrg____.pfm,c:\psfonts\zjrg____.pfb

If you were to select this font directly you would get the `default'
instance.  This is not recommded, rather call for the corresponding
ready-made instance.
