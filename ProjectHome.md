Y&Y TeX is a TeX system developed for Windows; it was originally a proprietary product, but is now free software. http://tug.org/yandy/ has more information and background.

Y&Y TeX was donated to the TeX Users Group (http://tug.org) by Blenda Horn, one of Y&Y's founders. Per Blenda's wishes, TUG has now released the sources under the GNU GPL.  Short documentation and other ancillary files are under an all-permissive license, since they could be useful to excerpt in other projects.
