\section{Introduction}

The main manual for the {\yandy} TeX System covers all of the information normally needed to get the system up and running and producing useful results. This Addendum delves more deeply into some of the issues raised in the manual and is intended primarily as a technical resource for expert users.

The Addendum's sections --- {\bf Font/Display Issues}, {\bf Printing Issues},
{\bf {\TeX} Issues}, and {\bf Operating System Issues} --- cover the broad
areas in which problems may arise. We follow them with an {\bf Appendix} that
includes answers to a variety of frequently asked questions.

Be sure also to consult % any 
Ûreadme.txtÛ and Ûnews.txtÛ files distributed
with {\DVIWindo}, {\DVIPSONE} and {\yandy} TeX for additional technical
information and late-breaking news about program functionality.

\section{Font/Display Issues}

Defined most 
precisely, a font is any set of characters that you access 
via a single name when typesetting a particular job. 
% It is possible (though not particularly easy) to set up a custom font whose
% characters come from several different fonts. So with enough time and energy,
% for example, you could define a `MyJob' font that contains Times-Roman `A,'
% `C,' `E,' etc, and Helvetica `B,' `D,' `F,' etc --- if that's what the
% typesetting job calls for.
Typically we think of a font as a predefined collection of
characters that are related in terms of character design, weight and
orientation: Times-Italic, for example. 

We group fonts having different weights and orientations but the same basic
character design into font families: for example, Times-Roman, Times-Italic,
Times-Bold and Times-BoldItalic comprise the Times family.

{\TeX}'s canonical font family is Computer Modern. This family is somewhat
unusual by current standards, in that it consists of optically scaled fonts.
Thus, 7-point Computer Modern Roman (CMR7) and 10-point Computer Modern Roman
(CMR10) are % two 
distinct fonts in the Computer Modern family, similar % identical 
in all respects except that the visual appearance of each character in CMR10
is slightly different from that of its counterpart in CMR7: in each case, the
character is optically `tuned' for optimum appearance at the specified size. 

Such optical scaling is the exception today; most other font families are
linearly scaled. For example, in the Lucida Bright family, one font (Lucida
Bright Roman) is the source of roman (regular) text at all sizes, a second
font (Lucida Bright Italic) provides italic text at all sizes, and so on.

Recently, `Multiple Master' (MM) font technology has made it possible to
have one `axis' devoted to optical scaling, so this refinement of typography
may yet become more widely available again (see also section~2.6.2).

\subsect{Font Encoding}

The characters in a font are accessed via numeric codes, typically between 0
and 255 (the range describable by 8-bit numbers). Many fonts, though, contain
more than 256 characters. Which of these characters are actually accessible
in an application depends on the platform (PC, Mac, Unix), the application,
and the font encoding. 

Some definitions:

\blist
\item {\bf Encoding vector} --- a mapping from numeric character codes to
characters.  Characters in the encoding vector are referred to by
character names (like `semicolon') in % the case of 
Type~1 fonts.
\endlist

\noindent In the case of TrueType fonts, the `ÛcmapÛ' plays the role of
`encoding vector.' It maps from numeric character code to sequential 
glyph program index within the font `program.'

\blist
\item {\bf Unencoded character} --- a character in a font that is not listed
in the current encoding vector, hence not accessible (without first
reencoding the font).  

\item {\bf Reencoding} --- providing a font with a new encoding vector.
This can make previously unencoded characters accessible,
and in addition can change the character layout.
\endlist

\noindent On a given platform, {\it text\/} font encoding is a predefined, 
system-level function. Windows, for example, automatically encodes text
fonts to `Windows {\ANSI}' character coding and uses `raw' or `native'
encoding for all other fonts (symbol, math, pi, and decorative fonts).
Similarly, the Mac operating system automatically encodes text fonts to `Mac
standard roman encoding' and uses native encoding for all `pi' fonts. (More
later on precisely what constitutes a text font.)

Furthermore, most applications on a given platform can only use % recognize
the text font encoding that the platform itself provides. % allows. 
Hence, for example, Microsoft Word on the PC platform can only `see' text
fonts as having Windows {\ANSI} encoding and all symbol/decorative fonts as
having their native encoding. 

The {\yandy} TeX System is the only Windows application that can override
Windows' system-level font encoding and implement %  recognize
arbitrary, user-defined reencoding. It performs % implements 
this `on-the-fly reencoding' without altering your Windows font files --- 
so they can also continue to be used in the normal manner by other Windows
applications. 

The system also provides a set of utilities through which you can permanently
{\it hard-reencode\/} your text fonts --- give them an arbitrarily defined
`native' encoding and force Windows to use that encoding. So, for
example, your Windows text fonts could be permanently reencoded to use the
Macintosh character set --- in {\it all\/} Windows applications, not just the
{\yandy} TeX System.  This, however, is rarely needed.

\subsect{Font-File Formats}

Before delving into the details of reencoding, you should understand how
fonts are physically stored and accessed in various systems. 

{\TeX} requires a {\TFM} (TeX Font Metrics) file for each font it uses. In
this file reside the values of the width, height and depth of each encoded
character in the font, along with kerning-pair values and ligature
information. {\TeX} uses this information in its typesetting calculations.
Confusingly, the {\TFM} {\it metric\/} file is referred to as a 
{\it font\/} in the {\TeX}-book.

The {\TFM} file does not itself contain the encoding vector definition;
yet it depends on the chosen encoding;
hence, if you subsequently choose a different encoding vector, you 
need different {\TFM} files
--- and these cannot be derived from the given {\TFM} files.

In the case of {\yandy} TeX, {\TFM} files for different encodings
are maintained in different drectory trees. 
One of these trees of {\TFM} files is active at any given time based on
the currently selected encoding.
% must generate new {\TFM} files.

The {\TFM} files are the only `font' files that {\TeX} itself requires. If a
{\TFM} file constructed according to the currently defined encoding is
available for each font used in your source document, you can successfully
`{\TeX}' the document to produce a corresponding {\DVI} (DeVice Independent)
file.

Once you have the {\DVI} file, {\TeX} itself is no longer involved; the
{\DVI} processor (previewer or printer driver) is what has to deal with the
actual
font itself (the description of the actual character shapes). In the {\yandy}
TeX System, {\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE} get this font description from font
files stored in Adobe Type~1 format (also termed `PostScript' format ---
a somewhat misleading terminology, since a Type~1 font can be rasterized by a
non-PS application like ATM, can be used to produce non-Post\-Script
output, and has distinctly non-Post\-Script code in its encrypted bowels). 

For each {\TFM} file used by {\TeX}, % a file, 
there must be a corresponding
Type~1 font with the corresponding glyphs and with the same metrics.
{\DVIWindo}, using one of the Windows PostScript drivers or {\yandy}'s own
{\DVIPSONE} PostScript driver, scales the appropriate characters from these
Type~1 fonts for insertion into the PostScript output. Adobe Type Manager
({\ATM}) scales the fonts on the fly to generate {\DVIWindo}'s screen
display. And for non-Postscript output, {\ATM} generates a rasterized,
printer-resolution version of that same screen display.

On the Windows platform, a Type~1 font consists of two files:

\blist
\item {\PFB} --- Printer Font Binary, a compact binary representation of the
 actual character `programs' in the font. 

\item {\PFM} --- Printer Font Metric, a compact binary metric file used by
Windows. It contains basic metric information such as character widths and
kerning pairs, but does not contain ligature information or the encoding
vector. It also contains the Windows Face Name of the font --- 
the name used in font menus. 
\endlist

\noindent Some other file formats are also used:

\blist
\item {\AFM} --- Adobe Font Metric, a human-readable superset of the {\PFM}
file; it is the font metric format that contains complete % metric
information. In it are basic font metric data such as character widths and
kerning pairs, plus ligature information, character bounding boxes, composite
character information and font properties. The {\AFM} file also contains the
encoding-vector information, as well as complete information on unencoded
characters. 

\item {\INF} --- A small plain {\ASCII} auxiliary file containing 
information (such as the Windows Face name) that {\ATM} uses when
it creates a
{\PFM} file from an {\AFM} file.  This is not usually needed. 

\item {\PFA} --- Printer Font {\ASCII}, a verbose hexadecimal representation of the {\PFB} file, commonly used on Unix/NeXT systems and containing exactly the same information as the {\PFB} file. Like the {\PFB}, it contains descriptions of the font's character outlines. It is also useful as an intermediate format when modifying an outline font file, since the {\PFB} file cannot be edited directly without disturbing binary segment length codes.
\endlist

\noindent As far as Windows is concerned, a Type~1 {\it text\/} font is one
in which {\yandy}'s {\DECODE} utility (described briefly in the main manual,
with additional details below) reports `Adobe StandardEncoding' for the
{\PFB} file and `Windows {\ANSI}' encoding for the {\PFM} file. If {\DECODE}
reports something else, then Windows or {\ATM} will treat the font as a
non-text font and use the font's `native' encoding --- whatever that
encoding has been set up to be. 

{\PFB} and {\PFM} files are required for viewing in {\DVIWindo}, and
both are required for printing from {\DVIWindo} using a Windows Postscript
driver. {\DVIPSONE}, on the other hand, requires % access
only the {\PFB} files. 

In all cases, the {\PFB} and {\PFM} files --- as reencoded by {\DVIWindo}
and {DVIPSONE} ---must agree with regard to font encoding --- between
themselves, with the corresponding {\TFM} files, and with the hardwired
encoding assumptions of any (La){\TeX} macros used in your source files. 
And therein lies a tangled tale\dots. 

\subsect{The Encoding Morass}

We usually think of text files as containing characters. But we know that they
`really' contain numeric codes (0--255) stored in 8-bit bytes. Yet the
illusion that they contain characters is persuasive. We press a key and see a
glyph drawn on the screen that (more or less) matches the character shown on
the key. We store the file, and when we retrieve it the same glyphs appear on
screen. We print a plain text file and the hard copy again shows the same
sorts of glyphs. The file really does appear to consist of characters.

At least that is what happens most of the time when we use plain {\ASCII}
characters --- the letters A--Z and a--z, the numerals 0--9 and perhaps some
32 or so punctuation and special characters. The fa\c cade cracks when we use
characters that do not belong to this limited set, for example, accented
characters --- like `A' with `dieresis' (\"A) --- or special symbols like the
ones for `copyright' (\char169) or `integral' ($\int$). Then what we see on
screen may not match what we key in, and what gets printed may not match what
we see on screen. Indeed, it may take several keystrokes or keystroke
combinations to enter such a character. But worst of all, what gets shown on
screen and what gets printed may depend both on the platform and on the setup
of the fonts in the printer. 

Suddenly the illusion is shattered. We realize that we {\it are\/} really
just dealing with numeric codes. % numbers

When we press a key, some numeric code (often 16 bits wide) is generated by
the keyboard. This is translated somewhere in the operating system and/or
application to some other numeric code (typically 8 bits wide) for
convenient storage and manipulation. We think of these codes as representing
characters (input side --- something with a certain semantics).    

A sequence of such codes may go through additional transformations and yield
other numeric codes (typically also 8 bits wide) that are then used for
output. We think of these latter codes as representing glyphs (output side
--- something with a characteristic shape). In the simplest case, the
numeric codes used for output are the same as those used for input, but this
need not always be the case.

Which numeric code is used to represent a particular character is purely a
matter of convention. Even for the upper case letter `A,' {\EBCDIC} uses a
different numeric code (193) than does {\ASCII} (65). Similarly, the numeric
code used to represent a particular glyph is also purely a matter of
convention. For example, Adobe StandardEncoding uses a different numeric code
for the ligature glyph `fi' (174) than does Macintosh standard roman encoding
(222).  

The mapping between `character' and numeric code, then, is quite arbitrary.
And because there are many more characters than the 256 numeric codes
possible with 8 bits, there is a need for more than one possible mapping or
`font encoding.' There can be no `standard' encoding that suits all
purposes, because the number of available numeric codes is much too small. 

\subsub{Whose problem?} If you always work on the same platform and always
use the same application, you may not yet have stumbled into the encoding
morass. On the other hand, if you move documents between platforms (or
sometimes even between applications on the same platform), you may have run
into problems, particularly with characters that are not in the basic
{\ASCII} set, such as ligatures and accented characters. 

Many encoding schemes agree on at least part of the code range, namely the
{\ASCII} character set between 32 and 126. But this leads to a false sense of
security. Even in this restricted range, one finds exceptions and
variations (such as `grave' versus `quoteleft', `hyphen' versus `minus,'
etc). So actually the only {\it really} dependably constant character set
comprises the upper and lower case letters and the digits (that is, if we
ignore {\EBCDIC}!).

\subsub{What's standard?} There are several dozen common encoding schemes,
each claiming to be general and important. Some try to encourage acceptance
by having names that suggest standardization. For example, there is `standard
roman encoding,' which is `standard' only on the Macintosh. And there is `MS
Windows {\ANSI},' which suggests a connection with the American National
Standards Institute, yet has changed twice as part of Windows upgrades. 
The `native' encoding of many Adobe Type~1 text fonts is `Adobe
StandardEncoding.' And in X Windows on Unix, ISO Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1) seems
to be the encoding in force, although, since Unix does not provide
system level support for scalable outline fonts, it isn't really clear.

All of these schemes have drawbacks. Adobe StandardEncoding does not provide
access to accented characters (such as \"A). MS Windows {\ANSI} does not
provide access to the ligatures `fi' and `fl.' Mac standard roman encoding
does not provide access to some % not-so-uncommon 
accented characters ---
% e.g., 
yacute (\'y), Yacute (\'Y), scaron (\v s), Scaron (\v S), zcaron (\v
z), Zcaron (\v Z) --- or to the Icelandic characters eth (\char240), Eth
(\char208), thorn (\char254) and Thorn (\char222). And so on. Hence the
solution does not simply lie in choosing one of these schemes and making it
the universal standard. 

\subsub{The solution (sort of)} Adobe had the right idea in introducing the
notion of the encoding vector in PostScript fonts, and in labelling glyphs with
character {\it names\/} rather than {\it numbers\/}. Unfortunately, few
applications allow the user to exploit this power. Indeed, most use a fixed
encoding methodology --- the one wired-in to the particular platform
involved --- that you cannot modify. 

% possibly flush next paragraph if space needed

One would think that font-generation software would be particularly likely to
take advantage of the notion of an encoding vector. Yet some of this software
uses a hardwired relationship between numbers and character names. That is,
the character names are used merely as aliases for numbers (NUL is 0, Eth is
1, eth is 2, Lslash is 3). % , \ellipsis). 
The character names bear no relationship to the glyphs. This is the worst
possible corruption of the PostScript encoding vector idea!

Because each platform has its own wired-in treatment of font encoding, and
because most applications have no way of affecting that treatment,
font-encoding problems often arise when moving text files between platforms.
There seem to be two strategies to deal with these problems: (a) accept that
applications on the two platforms use different encoding schemes, and
provide a `translation filter,' or (b) carry around the information about
which encoding is in use, either with the fonts or with the document. 

Presently the first strategy dominates. This has a serious drawback:
characters that exist in the encoding used on one platform but not the other
get lost.  Windows {\ANSI} and Macintosh standard roman encoding
have 200 glyphs in common, so 17 of the 217 characters in MS Windows {\ANSI}
do not exist in Mac standard roman encoding, while 23 of the 223 characters
in Mac standard roman encoding do not exist in MS Windows {\ANSI}). 

Note that this is not a Macintosh or Windows or Unix problem; it is
universal across all platforms. And it is not a problem specific to a
particular word-processing application or to {\TeX} --- it applies to all
software dealing with text. There can be no universally accepted encoding
(using 8-bit character codes) that is suitable for all purposes. 

Obviously the second alternative --- keeping track of what encoding a font
uses --- is better, but there is precious little software available today that
uses this idea. The {\yandy} TeX System is one of the few packages that
does. 

\subsub{Is Unicode the answer?} Unicode, with its 16-bit characters, may 
eventually help to resolve some of these problems. But it might not provide a
perfect solution, either. Unicode is by design a `character' encoding (input
side), not a `glyph' encoding (output side). This means
% , for example,
that it should ideally not be used for specifying `glyphs' in fonts for
printing. Purists insist, 
for example, that the ligatures `fi' and `fl' are `glyphs,' not `characters,'
and should not appear in Unicode
(although, as the result of the pressure of practical needs, they do now
have a place in Unicode after all).

Clearly what is needed is another universally agreed upon encoding scheme
(Uniglyph?) for specifying glyphs. For there can be no fine typesetting
without ligatures. 
% Unicode provides an encoding for characters, 
% and ligatures are not considered characters\dots.
Some operating systems (such as Windows~NT) % make the mistake of using 
use Unicode to encode glyphs also.
In an attempt to overcome the limitations of this approach,
some `alphabetic presentation forms' have been added 
to Unicode (used for the f-ligatures, for example)
and `Corporate Use Subareas' have been defined providing for
the definitions of alternate glyphs (such as `Scedilla' and `Scommaaccent').

Another approach, the AFII 32-bit glyph encoding standard, may provide the
answer. But it has yet to gain widespread acceptance. In the meantime, note
that Microsoft has Unicode in its platform, while Adobe is pushing AFII  
glyph names\dots. 

\subsect{Using On-The-Fly Reencoding}

Three gaping wounds in the {\TeX} environment prevent seamless electronic publishing:

\blist
\item Lack of standardization of Û\specialÛ for figure insertion
and other extensions of basic {\TeX};

\item Lack of standardization of names for non-CM fonts 
(although Karl Berry has made a valiant effort in this regard);

\item Lack of standardization of font encoding and a means of reencoding fonts, either on the fly or permanently.
\endlist

\noindent In each case, the {\DVI} processor (printer driver and/or
previewer) has to wrestle with these issues. 

The third of these deficiencies is our concern here. {\TeX}'s Computer Modern fonts alone use 10 different encoding schemes for the code range 0--127, and one has to depend on agreed-upon conventions about which font uses which, since {\TeX} has no provision for specifying an encoding vector in its metric files (aside from an optional field that may be used to record a short name for the encoding). Making matters even more difficult is the fact that assumptions about these {\CM} encodings are hardwired into commonly used formats such as plain {\TeX} and {\LaTeX}, and into many {\TeX} macro packages.

(Trivia buffs: Did you know that CMR5 uses a different encoding vector than
does CMR6 --- which supposedly is just the same font at another size? And
that only one of the 10 encodings used by Computer Modern agrees with
{\ASCII} even in the very restricted 64--126 range? This despite the fact
that {\TeX}'s internal code is often jokingly referred to as `{\ASCII},'
although Knuth is careful to say only that it is `based on' {\ASCII}.) 

It is very important to note that {\it reencoding\/} a font is a more general
operation than simply {\it remapping\/} the entries in the encoding vector
in order to achieve a different character layout. {\TeX}'s
virtual font mechanism, for example, allows one to renumber characters, but
it cannot make unencoded characters accessible. This is because --- like the
rest of {\TeX} --- it deals with characters strictly as numbers.  

Correspondingly, one cannot `reencode' a {\PFM} or {\TFM} file, since these
metric file formats contain no information about unencoded characters. One
has to refer back to more complete information, such as that provided in the
{\AFM} files, or find some way of regenerating that information. 

\subsub{No setup required} If you only use Computer Modern, on-the-fly
reencoding isn't available, since the process applies only to {\it text\/}
fonts and the Computer Modern fonts are not treated as text fonts. 

If you use
other fonts, and if you've installed the {\yandy} TeX System 2.1 from
scratch, then the encoding choice has been set up for you.
Check `Fonts{\down}Encoding,' or equivalently
the {\ENCODING} environment variable in the {\dviwindoini} file.
% is set up for you as part of the installation process, and 
So you need do nothing else unless you wish to subsequently switch to a
different encoding.  

% possibly flush next section if space needed

\subsub{`Reverting' previously hard-reencoded fonts} If you happen
to have text fonts
that were previously hard-reencoded for use with a much earlier version of the
{\yandy} TeX System, then reinstall those fonts directly from the original
diskettes using {\ATM}. If you no longer can locate the original {\PFB} and
{\PFM} files, then you need to `revert' the existing {\PFB} files to Adobe
StandardEncoding and create new {\PFM} files set up for Windows {\ANSI}.
These operations require {\AFM} files --- either the originals, or those
created via {\DVIWindo}'s `Write AFM\dots' function
(Create the {\AFM} files {\it
before\/} proceeding). % with the following operations.)

First create an empty temporary folder and make that the current folder. Use
the {\REENCODE} utility without any command line arguments (except perhaps
Û-vÛ for verbose output) on all of the {\PFB} files for the text fonts in
question. Note that {\REENCODE} can handle wild-card arguments. For example,
to redesignate each {\PFB} file in the Times family as using Adobe
StandardEncoding: 

\beginlines
Ûreencode -v c:\psfonts\ti*.pfbÛ
\endlines

\noindent {\REENCODE} is found in the Û\utilÛ subfolder of your main {\yandy} program folder. If this subfolder is not on your {\PATH}, you will have to specify a full path here and in the examples following.

Now create new {\PFM} files using {\AFMtoPFM} on the {\AFM} files, e.g.,

\beginlines
Ûafmtopfm -vx -c=ansinew c:\psfonts\afm\ti*.afmÛ
\endlines

\noindent Note that the encoding vector specified here should be `ansinew,'
{\it not\/} the new encoding vector you wish to use. That is because the
fonts will be installed as ordinary text fonts in Windows --- importantly,
on-the-fly reencoding does not require altering the standard, out-of-the-box
{\PFB} and {\PFM} files. 

To finish the job, `Remove' the old versions of the fonts using Adobe Type
Manager. (Tell {\ATM} to delete the fonts' source files to avoid confusion.)
Then `Add' the fonts from the temporary folder using {\ATM}, being sure to
tell {\ATM} to copy files during this process. Finally, delete everything in
the temporary folder.

\subsect{Using `Hard' Reencoding}

Given the {\yandy} TeX System's on-the-fly reencoding feature, it's logical
to ask why % whether
you would ever need to permanently reencode your fonts. If
your only need is to reencode text fonts for use in the {\yandy} TeX System,
you don't. But as just discussed, if you've previously hard-reencoded fonts
and no longer have them in their original form, you may have to hard-reencode
them back to that form. 

Moreover, you may wish to employ reencoded fonts in other Windows
applications --- none of which can perform on-the-fly reencoding. In this case,
the only alternative is hard reencoding: `fooling' Windows into thinking that
the fonts are {\it not\/} text fonts, so that Windows will instead use the
% chosen encoding as the 
fonts' `native' encoding. 

% possibly flush next paragraph if space needed

Finally, for various obscure reasons you may require only {\it some\/} of your text fonts to be reencoded in {\DVIWindo}. On-the-fly reencoding won't work in this case --- it's a `global' feature, applying to {\it all\/} text fonts in your system --- and again, hard reencoding is required.

In summary, only in very rare cases would you ever want to hard reencode
a font.  If you do, read this section.

The {\ENCODE} batch file, along with its companion {\DECODE} utility, simplifies the hard-reencoding process. In most cases, you can let {\encodebat} do all the work and avoid working directly with the underlying font encoding utilities.

Be warned, though: permanently reencoding a font is a nontrivial task. If you decide to do it, you should always keep a copy of the original font metric files ({\PFM} and {\TFM}) and the font outline file ({\PFB}) in a safe place. In addition, if at all possible, try to work with the original {\AFM} files --- the ones that came with the fonts. In the case of Adobe fonts, if you don't have these {\AFM} files you can obtain them from Adobe's file server  
Ûftp.adobe.comÛ, or from `hidden' files on the `Type on Call' CD-ROM.

Before we go on, it should be emphasized again:
you do not normally have to hard reencode fonts.

\subsub{Additional font-file details} Before we plunge into the nitty gritty
details of using {\encodebat} and its companion utilities, here is a quick
rundown of some key additional features of the files these programs
manipulate. 

Every Adobe Type~1 font file ({\PFB} or {\PFA}) has the encoding vector
explicitly listed near its beginning, following Û/Encoding 256 array defÛ,
typically using lines of the form: 

\beginlines
Ûdup Û\angi{code}Û /Û\angi{name}Û putÛ
\endlines

\noindent For example,

\beginlines
Ûdup 32 /space putÛ
\endlines

\noindent Actually, plain vanilla {\it text\/} fonts use Adobe
StandardEncoding here, in which case the line  

\beginlines
Û/Encoding StandardEncoding defÛ 
\endlines

\noindent 
appears instead (to see StandardEncoding, look in Ûstandard.vecÛ).

The corresponding {\AFM} file always contains the encoding explicitly. In
this file, following the line containing the word ÛStartCharMetricsÛ, are
lines of the form

\beginlines
ÛC Û\angi{code}Û ; WX Û\angi{width}Û ; N Û\angi{name}Û ; B Û\angi{xll} \angi{yll} \angi{xur} \angi{yur};
\endlines

\noindent The {\AFM} file also lists unencoded characters, each with character code $-$1. These characters do not appear in the font's encoding, and their names cannot be ascertained from the {\PFB} file (without decrypting it and listing the ÛCharStringsÛ dictionary).

{\TFM} files do not contain the encoding (which is one reason why they are so
compact). While there is an optional field that can be used to note the name
of an encoding, there is no space for a full encoding vector. {\TFM} files
produced by {\AFMtoTFM}, however, do contain either the standard {\TeX} name
for an encoding (e.g., TeX Text) or the name of the encoding vector file (in
the case when it is not one of the `standard' encoding vectors defined for
Computer Modern fonts).

In addition, the `checksum' in the {\TFM} file is derived from the first six
characters of the encoding vector name.  {\TeX} copies this
checksum into the {\DVI} file along with the {\TFM} file name.  This makes
it possible for {\DVI} processors (like {\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE}) to
warn you about encoding conflicts with a meaningful message that
helps determine which encoding vector was used to make the {\TFM} files.

Like {\TFM} files, Windows {\PFM} files do not contain the encoding.
{\PFM} files produced by {\AFMtoPFM} contain either the standard {\TeX} name
for an encoding (e.g., TeX Text) or the name of the encoding vector file
(when it is not one of the `standard' encoding vectors defined for Computer
Modern fonts). In either case, the name follows the string `ÛEncoding: Û.'

\subsub{ENCODE usage} {\ENCODE} assumes that you have already `installed' the
fonts in  question (perhaps with an encoding that you do not now wish to
use).  That is, {\ATM} has been used to `Add' the fonts, and there are
already  {\PFB}, {\PFM} and perhaps {\TFM} files for the fonts in the
appropriate  folders.

To use {\encodebat}, you must first `Remove' the fonts that are to be
altered, using the {\ATM} Control Panel. (But do {\it not\/} tell {\ATM} to
delete the fonts' source files.) Then type 

\beginlines
Ûencode Û\angi{vect} \angi{afm-dir} \angi{pfb-dir} \angi{tfm-dir} \angi{win-dir} Û[W|N]Û \angi{font-1} Û...Û
\endlines

\noindent where

\blist
\item \angi{vect} is the name of the encoding vector file. This may be a fully qualified file name, or instead refer to a vector file in the current folder, or to a vector file in the folder pointed to by the environment variable {\VECPATH}.

\item \angi{afm-dir} specifies the folder containing file \angi{font}Û.afmÛ

\item \angi{pfb-dir} specifies the folder containing file \angi{font}Û.pfbÛ (The {\PFM} files are assumed to be in the {\PFM} subfolder of this folder --- or in the {\PFB} folder itself, if there is no {\PFM} subfolder.)

\item \angi{tfm-dir} specifies the folder containing file \angi{font}Û.tfmÛ

\item \angi{win-dir} specifies the Windows folder --- where {\atmini} may be found

\item ÛWÛ requests that modified {\TFM} files overwrite original versions, and ÛNÛ requests overwriting {\it no\/} files

\item \angi{font-1} is the name of the first font file, without extension,
and without trailing underscores (if any); e.g., for file Ûtir_____.pfbÛ use
ÛtirÛ.
\endlist

\noindent The {\encodebat} batch file resides in the Û\utilÛ subfolder of
your main ÛyandyÛ program folder; as before, if that folder is not on your
{\PATH}, you will have to specify the full path to {\encodebat} in the
command line shown above. Note, too, that you can specify more than one font
to modify. In fact, it is usually best to reencode all four styles of a
family (regular, bold, italic, bold italic) at the same time. 

Modified {\PFB}, {\PFM}, and {\TFM} files all appear in the current folder (and the modified {\TFM}s also overwrite the originals if ÛWÛ is specified). When the process is complete, `Add' the {\PFB} and {\PFM} files, using the {\ATM} Control Panel. Tell {\ATM} to copy the files (thus overwriting the originals in your Ûc:\psfontsÛ folder). Once the files are installed in this manner, you can delete the versions in the current folder.

Note that {\ENCODE} may use a significant amount of temporary file space. Make sure that your {\TEMP} environment variable points to a folder that has at least several hundred kilobytes of space (ideally a RAM disk).

Here are several additional % important 
points regarding {\ENCODE} usage:

\blist
\item There is a limit on the allowed length of any command typed at a command prompt. If the command line threatens to get too long, work on one font at a time, or first copy the {\AFM} files to the current folder, so as to shorten the command line.

\item {\ENCODE} tries to include as many of the `standard' {\TeX} ligatures and pseudo ligatures in the {\TFM} file as possible, unless the font is fixed pitch, in which case even real ligatures in the {\AFM} file are suppressed. (Additional useful pseudo ligatures may also be generated.)

\item {\ENCODE} adds control-character reencoding, if control character positions 0--31 contain encoded characters and if the remapped positions (161--196) are not already occupied. (It is then possible to access characters in the range 0--9 via 161--170 and characters in the range 10--31 via 173--194.)

\item {\ENCODE} sets up the {\PFM} and {\PFB} files so that {\ATM} (taking its cue from the {\PFB} file) and the Windows PostScript driver {\pscriptdrv} (taking its cue from the {\PFM} file) agree on whether the font is to be reencoded to Windows {\ANSI}.

\item If it deems it prudent, {\ENCODE} `immunizes' the {\PFB} file (by using {\yandy}'s {\SAFESEAC} utility; see below) to make it safe from {\ATM} for Windows, which exhibits a misfeature relating to accented characters when a font does not use Windows {\ANSI} encoding. The {\PFB} file is not changed if the file has already been `immunized' or uses an encoding known to be safe (e.g., an encoding that does not contain any accented characters).

\item {\ENCODE} extends the Windows Face Name of a font with a trailing `X' (unless it already ends with an `X'). This has to be done to avoid a misfeature in the Windows PostScript driver, which contains hardwired {\PFM} information for 83 fonts (without the `X' it may ignore the changes you make).

\item {\ENCODE} tries to ascertain the Windows Face Name for the font from an existing {\PFM} file. If it cannot find one, it creates a suitable Face Name from the font's PostScript FontName by dropping style modifiers (`Italic,' `Bold' etc).
\endlist

\noindent Just keep in mind that in general, with {\yandy} TeX's ability
to reencode fonts on-the-fly, you typically won't need to hard-reencode
any fonts.

\subsub{When ENCODE isn't sufficient} There may be cases where the {\ENCODE} batch file does not provide sufficient flexibility, and you have to instead resort to using separately the utilities that it calls. In such situations, you can use the {\REENCODE} utility to reencode the {\PFB} file, the {\AFMtoPFM} utility to create a new {\PFM} file, and the {\AFMtoTFM} utility to create a new {\TFM} file.

As we've seen, Windows only provides for two ways to use a font: 
(a) as a `text' font, reencoded to Windows {\ANSI} character encoding 
(the default), or 
(b) as a `symbol' font, with the font's native encoding. 
Which of these encoding schemes is used by the PostScript printer driver
depends on how the {\PFM} file is set up. One can force use of native
encoding by setting the `Family' field to `Decorative' using the command line
flag ÛdÛ when using {\AFMtoPFM}. You should also set the ÛCharSetÛ field to
`Symbol' in this case, using the command line flag ÛsÛ.

% which is actually the important one? in Type 1 it is `decorative'

{\ATM}, which controls on-screen display and non-PostScript printing, has a different criterion. It assumes Windows {\ANSI} reencoding if the {\PFB} file contains the line Û/Encoding StandardEncoding defÛ (somewhat bizarre!). So to have {\ATM} use `native' encoding, one must avoid this line in the {\PFB} file.

If the font uses StandardEncoding and one wishes to actually use that
encoding in Windows (a pretty unlikely situtation), then the font has to be
`standardized.' This is a little trick that {\REENCODE} can perform, whereby
Adobe's StandardEncoding is spelled out line by line to fool {\ATM} into
thinking that StandardEncoding is in fact {\it not\/} being used. Without
this ploy, current versions of {\ATM} force reencoding to Windows {\ANSI}. To
`standardize' a font, use `standard' as the name of the encoding vector file:

\beginlines
Ûreencode -v -c=standard tir.pfbÛ
\endlines

\noindent The outline font file ({\PFB} or {\PFA}) does not have to be
reencoded when (a) the font already has the desired encoding (other than
StandardEncoding), or (b) the font uses StandardEncoding, and Windows {\ANSI}
is to be used. 
% In this case set the environment variable {\TEXANSI} to 1 in the [Window]
% section of your {\dviwindoini} file. 

\subsub{Pitfalls in the REENCODE process} A summary: To reencode a previously installed font using {\ENCODE}'s companion utilities, you first `Remove' the font, using the {\ATM} Control Panel. Then use {\REENCODE} to make a new {\PFB} file and {\AFMtoPFM} to make a new {\PFM} file, making sure to use the ÛsÛ and ÛdÛ command line arguments. For use with {\TeX}, also make a new {\TFM} file using {\AFMtoTFM}. Then install the new {\PFB} and {\PFM} file using `Add' in the {\ATM} Control Panel. This does the trick for {\ATM}. It also works in most cases for the Windows PostScript printer driver, {\pscriptdrv}.

But this % it 
does not always work for fonts for which {\pscriptdrv} contains
hardwired data. The Windows PostScript printer driver contains 
% (inside itself) 
the data from {\PFM} files for a number of fonts (currently 83), 
including the
usual 35 printer-resident fonts. It may ignore what you do to these fonts,
because it `knows' they are printer resident. Changing the font file name
does not help, nor does changing the PostScript FontName, because
{\pscriptdrv} recognizes a font based on the Windows Face Name. 

The solution to this problem is to use {\AFMtoPFM} with the command line
argument ÛXÛ, which appends an `X' to the Face Name (unless it already ends
in X or if the encoding is `ansinew,' in which case ÛXÛ causes removal of
any trailing X on the Windows Face Name). Or use the ÛwÛ command line
argument to specify the Windows Face Name (and specify the desired encoding
using the command line argument Û-cÛ): 

\beginlines
Ûafmtopfm -vsdX -c=myencode ncr.afmÛ
\endlines

\noindent or

\beginlines
Ûafmtopfm -vsd -c=myencode -w=NewCenturySchlbkX ncr.afmÛ
\endlines

\noindent To see a list of the command line flags and command line arguments
each of the utility programs takes, invoke them with Û-?Û as the only
argument (e.g., Ûafmtopfm -?Û). For most utilities this list shows all
available command line options. For {\AFMtoTFM} the options are more
extensive; see the Appendix for a complete list in that case.

\subsub{Examples of manual reencoding} As we've said, the easiest way to keep the {\PFM}, {\PFB} and {\TFM} files `synchronized' is to use the {\ENCODE} batch file. But if your particular needs force doing it the painful `manual' way\dots

\nlist
\item To permanently reencode a font to use `TeX 'n {\ANSI}' encoding:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûafmtotfm -vad -c=texnansi c:\yandy\fonts\afm\tir.afmÛ
Ûafmtopfm -vsdt -c=texnansi c:\yandy\fonts\afm\tir.afmÛ
Ûreencode -vt -c=texnansi c:\psfonts\tir.pfbÛ
}
\endlines

\item To force use of a font's native encoding (assuming that the font does not use StandardEncoding):

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûafmtotfm -va -c=none c:\yandy\fonts\afm\lbme.afmÛ
Ûafmtopfm -vsd -c=none c:\yandy\fonts\afm\lbme.afmÛ
}
\endlines

\noindent (Specifying `none' here means `use the encoding in the {\AFM} file.') If the font's native encoding is StandardEncoding, then you also have to execute:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûreencode -v -c=standard c:\psfonts\tir.pfbÛ
}
\endlines

\item To reencode a font to Windows {\ANSI} (the Windows default):

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûafmtotfm -vad -c=ansinew c:\yandy\fonts\afm\tir.afmÛ
Ûafmtopfm -v -c=ansinew c:\yandy\fonts\afm\tir.afmÛ
}
\endlines

\noindent In this case there is no need to do anything to the {\PFB} file itself --- it is automatically reencoded by {\ATM} to Windows {\ANSI}, provided it has the StandardEncoding line described above. If it does not presently use StandardEncoding, then do the following:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûreencode -v c:\psfonts\tir.pfbÛ
}
\endlines

\item To reencode a font to use StandardEncoding:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûafmtotfm -vad -c=standard c:\yandy\fonts\afm\tir.afmÛ
Ûafmtopfm -vsd -c=standard c:\yandy\fonts\afm\tir.afmÛ
Ûreencode -v -c=standard c:\psfonts\tir.pfbÛ
}
\endlines

\noindent Note that the {\PFB} file itself must be reencoded (`standardized') even if its native encoding happens to be StandardEncoding already (see explanation above).
\endlist

\noindent Encodings with accents (and base characters) in different positions may not work with Windows software (unless you at least use {\SAFESEAC} to `immunize' the {\PFB} file).

Sometimes it is convenient to edit the outline font file itself. This is another way of modifying the encoding, the font matrix, and the actual PostScript FontName. But don't try to edit a {\PFB} file directly, even with an editor that can handle 8-bit character codes. A {\PFB} file has embedded binary length codes, which will be in error if there are any changes in the lengths of any of the sections of the file.

Instead, convert from {\PFB} to {\PFA} format using {\PFBtoPFA}, then edit the {\PFA} file and convert back to {\PFB} format, using {\PFAtoPFB}. The {\PFA} file is in plain {\ASCII} (including a huge section all in hexadecimal) and can be safely read into a `text only' editor.

\subsub{What can go wrong with reencoding?} Properly modified font files
created using {\encodebat} should cause no problems. You most likely have an
encoding problem when ligatures (fi, fl, etc) don't show up at all or show
incorrectly (for example, you get the % registered trademark 
`{\char174}' symbol), 
when special characters (like endash and emdash) don't show correctly, when
instead of `quoteleft' you get the `grave' accent and instead of `quoteright'
you get `quotesingle' (`straight quote'), when `hat' and `tilde' accents in
math show up too large and too low, when characters mysteriously disappear,
when accents don't show up, or when on-screen display doesn't match printed
output.

Such problems usually result from mismatches in the encoding assumed when making the {\PFB} file, when making the {\PFM} file, when making the {\TFM} file, and when writing the {\TeX} macro headers used in your source file.

Actually, one of the best early clues of encoding problems is the {\TeX} complaint:

\beginlines
ÛMissing character: There is no ... in font ...!Û
\endlines

\noindent In most implementations of {\TeX}
this very important error message only shows up in
the log file  --- and then without any
indication of where the error occurred. In {\yandy} TeX you will be
notified on screen and in the log file of any `missing characters' and be
given the context. 

Another common sign of encoding problems is that `{\lbrace}' and `{\rbrace}'
and underscore don't come out right. Such problems 
arise because % result from the fact that 
the Computer Modern fonts do not follow the {\ASCII} layout even in the
restricted 32--127 range (instead of {\lbrace} in position 123, TeX Text
encoding has `endash,' instead of {\rbrace} in position 125, there is
`hungarumlaut,' instead of `underscore' in position 95, there is
`dotaccent'). 

For a painful illustration of what can happen, see Paul W. Abrahams, `{\TeX}
for the Impatient' (Addison-Wesley ISBN 0-201-51375-7). In that case, the
{\TFM} files were apparently set up for Adobe StandardEncoding, but the fonts
themselves were set up for TeX Text encoding. See `Erratum' in the back of
the book for additional details. {\DVI}-to-PostScript printer drivers (like
{\DVIPS}) that refer to {\TFM} metric files are particularly subject to this
sort of problem.

Hard reencoding problems can arise from several other sources:

\blist
\item All members of a font family should be reencoded together. This prevents problems with `font harmonizing' software --- and with {\ATM} itself. If you change the roman (regular) member of a family, but do not change the rest, there will be `orphaned styles' that can lead to peculiar results. For example, if you use {\ENCODE} on the roman style of `Times,' then the modified font will have Windows Face Name `TimesX.' The other three styles will still be there under the Face Name `Times.' Selecting the roman style of `Times,' however, will yield an italic font, since there is no roman style with that Windows Face Name anymore, only italic, bold and bold italic.

\item The Windows PostScript driver ({\pscriptdrv}) caches font metric information just like {\ATM} does. For this purpose, it uses files with extension Û.fsfÛ in the Windows folder. You do not normally have to delete these Û*.fsfÛ files. The driver is smart enough (most of the time) to realize that you have made some change, and then rebuild these files the next time you try to print (which may take a while if you have a few hundred fonts). Should you get inappropriate font selections when printing after making a change, exit Windows, relaunch and try again. If the problem persists (but on-screen display is OK), delete the Û*.fsfÛ files. You can check whether the Û*.fsfÛ files have been rebuilt by {\pscriptdrv} since you last modified a font by looking at the file creation time.

\item If you use Adobe's Windows PostScript driver ({\adobepsdrv}) you may
need to delete its metric cache. This is a file in the Windows folder with
extension Û.ebfÛ.  

\item Your printer may keep a cache of glyphs that it has already rendered (to implement `across job' font caching). This cache is supposed to be organized on character name, not numeric code, so everything should work fine without flushing it. But the process does not work correctly on some PostScript `clones.' If you have any doubts, then power cycle the printer before printing using the reencoded font.

\item Try not to use Adobe's `Windows 3.0 Font Downloader,' or the Adobe {\PCSEND} and {\PSDOWN} utilities. Aside from being slow and user-unfriendly, some of the Adobe downloaders only work with fonts whose names are padded out to 8 characters with underscores (and do not have more than five or six characters in their file names). If you do have to download fonts, use {\DOWNLOAD}, supplied with the {\yandy} TeX System.

\item Ready-made `format' files may cause difficulties. A {\TeX} format file
is a dump of the state of {\TeX} after reading some {\TeX} macro header
files. In the {\yandy} TeX System, we supply ready-made format files for the
default `plain {\TeX}' and for {\AmSTeX}, and also for {\LaTeX}~2.09 and
{\LaTeXe} if you choose to install them. Reading in such a format file is
faster than interpreting the corresponding {\TeX} macro header files.
Unfortunately, the state of {\TeX} saved in a format file also includes any
{\TFM} files loaded at the time it is dumped. {\TeX} will {\it ignore\/} new
versions of {\TFM} files if it already has copies of {\TFM} files for the
fonts in question in a format file. As a result, format files are encoding
dependent, and you will have to remake formats (via `ini{\TeX}') when you
change the encoding of any fonts used in that format. This doesn't normally
apply to formats using only Computer Modern (such as the usual plain {\TeX}
and {\LaTeX} formats), of course, since the encoding of Computer Modern
fonts is supposed to be fixed.

% \item A more specialized problem: The current version of Adobe Illustrator
% has trouble with fonts not encoded to Windows {\ANSI}, and in the process
% it messes up font menus for other applications. You can avoid this
%  difficulty by (a) starting up the WordPad application, (b) selecting `Fonts'
%  from its `Character' menu, and (c) minimizing WordPad. Doing so somehow
%  prevents Illustrator from corrupting {\ATM}. (This bug may have been fixed
%  in the new Illustrator release.) 
\endlist

\subsub{Using DECODE to analyze reencoding problems} {\DECODE} allows you to verify that an outline font and its associated metric files have all been made using the same encoding. This is not a trivial task, since each file format lacks some important piece of information.

However, the {\PFM} and {\TFM} files made using {\AFMtoPFM} and {\AFMtoTFM} do carry some hidden information that gives the name of the encoding vector, or a short description, and {\DECODE} reveals this information.

{\DECODE} accepts wildcard file specifications, so you can ask for
information about several font metric files at once. You may be able to gain
some additional insight using the Û-vÛ (verbose) command line flag, e.g., 

\beginlines
Ûdecode -v c:\psfonts\pfm\*.pfmÛ
\endlines

\noindent On the other hand, the added verbosity may obscure important information. These commands will not produce useful information if the metric file does not contain the extra `hidden' fields.

If you have both the original {\AFM} metric file and a bunch of encoding vector files, more definitive information may result from using a command line of the form:

\beginlines
Ûdecode -a=Û\angi{afm-file} \angi{tfm-file} \angi{enc-dir}Û\*.vecÛ
\endlines

\noindent where \angi{afm-file} and \angi{tfm-file} are fully qualified (full path) names, and \angi{enc-dir} is the folder where encoding vectors reside --- typically the Û\fonts\encodingÛ subfolder of the main {\yandy} program folder. This causes {\DECODE} to try and reencode the information in the {\AFM} file using each of the encoding vectors in turn, until it matches the information in the specified {\TFM} (or {\PFM}) file. ({\DECODE} may get confused by some fixed-width fonts, since permutations of the encoding vector do not change the font metrics.)

If an {\AFM} file is specified, then it doesn't make much sense to use wild cards for the metric file name --- but wild cards can come in handy for the encoding vector files, as shown in the example above.

The {\PFB} outline font file itself has the encoding vector spelled out in detail, but in this case, instead of a listing of the encoding vector, one typically wants to know which existing encoding vector file this matches. {\DECODE} can be used to discover this information:

\beginlines
Ûdecode -a=Û\angi{afm-file} Ûc:\psfonts\Û\angi{pfb-file} \angi{enc-dir}Û\*.vecÛ
\endlines

\noindent If your {\PFB} files reside in some other folder, substitute that folder for Ûc:\psfonts\Û. {\DECODE} also checks whether the encoding in the {\PFB} file happens to match that in the {\AFM} file, and whether reencoding of control characters is being used, i.e., if positions 0--9 are remapped to 161--170 and 10--31 are remapped to 173--194. (The {\PFB} and {\PFM} files should either both show reencoding of control characters, or neither one should --- and the {\TFM} file should never show this.)

Two additional points about {\DECODE} usage:

\blist
\item {\DECODE} complains if the encoding is `Windows {\ANSI},' yet the
`symbol' or `decorative' flags are set. Conversely, {\DECODE} complains if
the encoding is not `Windows {\ANSI}' and the `symbol' and `decorative'
flags are {\it not\/} set. (Both of these combinations are inconsistent and
lead to problems.) 

\item {\DECODE} also checks whether the encoding in the {\PFM} or {\TFM} file happens to match that in the {\AFM} file.
\endlist

\subsect{Some Notes On ATM}

The foregoing font-encoding discussions include copious references to Adobe
Type Manager. This is not surprising, since, as the engine both for using
Type~1 fonts to produce {\DVIWindo}'s display and output to non-PostScript
printers, {\ATM} is a key font/display-system component. 
%
Early versions of {\ATM} had problems. Fortunately, most of these have 
been fixed in the recent versions, leaving only a few pitfalls for the unwary.

The most recent version of {\ATM} for Windows is 4.0
(Note that {\ATM} 4.0 for Windows 95/98 is a 
different program from {\ATM} 4.0 for Windows NT).
The earliest version
that {\yandy} recommends you use is 2.6. 
% If you have an earlier version than 2.6, please upgrade. 
% And 
If you use Hewlett-Packard printers in {\PCL} mode (as
opposed to PostScript) in Windows~95/98, then you need {\it at least\/}
{\ATM} version 3.02 (see also Ûwin95.txtÛ).

\subsub{General considerations} The {\ATM} manual and the {\ATM} Technical
Reference Guide (file Ûtechref.wriÛ on the {\ATM} CD or diskette)
contain both basic information on the program's use and a wealth of more
detailed technical discussion. What follows here are extra information and
fine points: 

\blist
\item Specify an {\ATM} font cache of at {\it least\/} 512k. Performance with
smaller values can be very slow. 
%
% However, if you set {\ATM}'s font cache to be larger than the amount of
% memory available on your PC, you may not be able to run the {\ATM} Control
% Panel. If this happens, use a {\DOS} editor to delete the line
% ÛFontCache=Û\angi{xxx} in the {\atmini} file. Then restart Windows and use
% the {\ATM} Control Panel to set the font cache to the desired value.

\item {\ATM} substitutes its scalable Times-Roman and Helvetica for Windows'
Roman and Modern, respectively, in order to eliminate the `stick-figure'
appearance of these fonts. If you don't want {\ATM} to make this
substitution, delete the following two lines from the [Aliases] section of
your {\atmini} file:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
ÛRoman=TimesÛ
ÛPS Modern=HelveticaÛ
}
\endlines

\item If there are problems, % In general, 
eliminate as many lines as possible from the [Synonyms] and [Aliases]
sections of the {\atmini} file. Usually many of these lines are either
redundant or left over from earlier versions of {\ATM}. 
%
% In some cases they form circular loops! In particular, you do not want a
% line like ÛTimes=TimesNewRomanPSÛ (unless you don't have Times-Roman). But
% do keep the line ÛCourier=CourierÛ to make sure {\ATM} gives you the font
% size you request for Courier. 

\item If you print to a {\PCL} printer using {\ATM} fonts and get jagged,
bitmapped text, you may not have the most recent version of the printer
driver. If this happens, and you have selected the correct resolution (300
dpi) in the Windows `Properties' dialog for the printer, contact
Microsoft or the printer vendor for an updated version of the driver. 
Typically these can be found on the vendor's web site.

\item If you print colored text with the `Color as black' option in the
`Print' dialog box unchecked, the lighter colors will not be printed to
{\PCL} printers. If you print with colored fonts on a black/white printer,
the colors will be translated to gray-levels and you will get spotty or
mottled letters. 

\item If your Hewlett-Packard printer ejects pages before they are completed,
then you may be % are probably 
using more softfonts per page than it can handle. In
this case, check `Print fonts as Graphics' in the {\ATM} Control Panel, which
slows printing but solves the problem. 

\item Do not 
select % run {\ATM} with 
`Use Pre-built or Resident Bitmap Fonts' % checked
in the {\ATM} Control Panel. Unless your printer has fairly low memory (1
megabyte or less), we strongly recommend that this option not be checked.
{\ATM} will then use outline (scalable) fonts in all cases, with a consistent
set of font metrics for each point size. If the option is checked, {\ATM}
uses whatever bitmapped fonts it has, turning to outline fonts only when
necessary. When bitmapped and outline fonts are mingled in this way, your
fonts will not have a consistent appearance across all point sizes. 

\item There is a limit to how many fonts you can install for {\ATM}. 
% In Windows 3.1x, this limit was governed strictly by the fact that the
% {\winini} and {\atmini} files, which list all of the installed fonts, had
% to be smaller than 64k. 
In Windows~95/98, there is a 64k byte limit on {\winini}.
If you use {\ATM} 4.0, this is less of a problem,
since with that version you can `group' fonts and `activate' only those
groups that you need for a given job, rewriting {\winini} on the fly as
required.  Nevertheless, {\winini} can grow rapidly if you install fonts to
many different ports assigned to PostScript printers, since it contains a
complete list of softfonts for each port. So avoid such installations if
possible. 

\item Many applications (such as Microsoft Word) % for Windows) 
have their own
internal limitations on the number of fonts they can handle in their menus.
Those above the limit that appear at the end of the softfonts lists in
{\winini} will be dropped without notice. 

\item If, after {\ATM} is already installed, you install a new printer that's similar or identical to one you already assigned to a different port, {\ATM} fonts may not be available when you target the new printer. The problem is that {\ATM} does not automatically conclude that the two printers should have the same set of fonts. If your {\ATM} font names display a question mark in the `Font' submenu, reinstall your {\ATM} fonts. In the installation process, {\ATM} will read the {\winini} file and thereby learn about the new port assignments. 
\endlist

\subsub{ATM and Multiple Masters} Multiple Master ({\MM}) fonts come with
ready-made prime instances. With {\ATM} 3.0 and higher, you can also create
new instances of these fonts.  For serious work with Multiple Master fonts 
we recommend {\ATM}~4.0 Deluxe.

When {\ATM} creates a Multiple Master instance in Windows95/98, it creates 
a new {\PFM} file and a new PostScript Stub ({\PSS}) file. The base {\MM}
font is contained in a {\PFB} file and its metrics in a Multiple Master
Metrics ({\MMM}) file. The {\PFM} files for the {\MM} instances have names
that end in a 3-digit number.  Make a note of these file names
when creating the {\TFM} file for the font using `WriteTFM...'

In Windows~95/98 you can also find out which {\PFM} file corresponds
to which {\MM} instance by looking in {\atmini}. 
% There, 
You'll find entries like:

% ®MDRV¯following is hard coded (adjust indent) to squeeze onto one line®MDNM¯
% \vskip6.5\p@ plus1.95\p@ minus.975\p@ \begingroup
\beginlines
{\parindent-6\p@
ÛTektoMM_240 RG 564 NO=c:\psfonts\pfm\zjrg_004.pfm,c:\psfonts\zjrg_004.pssÛ
}
\endlines

\noindent The Windows Face Name is the part before the equals sign. The first
few letters give the base {\MM} font name --- `TektoMM' in this case. In the
illustration here, the first axis (weight) is 240 and the RG denotes Regular.
The second axis (width) is set to 564 and the NO indicates Normal. (The {\it
RG}, {\it NO}, etc are upper case in the names of prime instances, and lower
case in user-created instances.)  
When using ATM~4.0 you can also get this information by running the
ÛatmreganÛ utility, which analyses the Ûatmreg.atmÛ file
in the Windows folder.

The corresponding {\PFM} file is Ûc:\psfonts\pfm\zjrg_004.pfmÛ. The line also refers to the stub Ûc:\psfonts\zjrg_004.pssÛ. This defines the instance in terms of the base {\MM} font, which itself is defined by the following entry in the {\atmini} file:

\beginlines
ÛTektoMM=c:\psfonts\pfm\zjrg____.pfm,c:\psfonts\zjrg____.pfbÛ
\endlines

\noindent If you were to select this font directly, you would get the `default' instance. This is not recommended; rather, you should call for the corresponding ready-made instance.

To use a {\MM} instance with {\TeX}, you need a {\TFM} file. However, {\AFMtoTFM} cannot interpret {\MMM} files, only ordinary {\AFM}s. Fortunately, in {\DVIWindo}, you can use the `Write TFM\dots' function instead. This function also writes an intermediate {\AFM} file in the Û\fonts\afmÛ subfolder of your main {\yandy} program folder; should there be any problems, you can inspect this file and run {\AFMtoTFM} `manually' on an edited version of it, if necessary.

There is also an alternate, less desirable method for getting an {\AFM} file for a {\MM} instance. You can use {\PFMtoAFM} to extract a metrics file in {\AFM} format from the {\PFM} file. The resulting {\AFM} file is placed in the current folder. The file will not be as complete or accurate as an {\AFM} file created by the first method, but it may be adequate for the purpose at hand. 

Once you have this {\AFM} file, use {\AFMtoTFM} to create a suitable {\TFM} file for {\TeX} (use the encoding specified by ÛENCODING=...Û). Then copy the {\TFM} file to where {\TeX} expects to find its {\TFM} files.

\subsub{ATM versus PSCRIPT.DRV} {\ATM} controls the rendering both on screen
and for non-Postscript printing. Hence, with these devices the chance of a
major disagreement between on-screen display and printer output is slim. 
Except for printers that handle downloaded `softfonts' % 96/Aug/26
(and buggy {\PCL} printer drivers in Windows~95 --- see Ûwin95.txtÛ).

{\ATM} does not get into the act when you are printing to a PostScript printer; the Windows printer driver does all the work. So it is --- unfortunately --- possible to see inconsistencies between screen display and printed output, since one is handled entirely by {\ATM}, and the other entirely by the PostScript driver.

For example, there will be a major problem if you edit {\atmini} and change the `Face Name' of some font (the name that appears in font menus). Text using this font will display fine on screen, but will be printed using something inappropriate (say, LucidaBlackletter). The reason is that {\DVIWindo} looks in {\atmini} to figure out what Face Name to use to request a particular font. The name in {\atmini} is the Face Name that {\ATM} recognizes. The PostScript printer driver, on the other hand, looks in the {\PFM} metric files.

{\ATM} extracts the face name from the {\PFM} file, but only once --- when
the font is first installed. It then inserts the name into {\atmini}, and
thereafter relies on that name. The PostScript driver, on the other hand,
extracts the Face Name from the {\PFM} file each time it opens a printer
device context. (It does not read {\atmini}, of course.) If you change the
name recorded in {\atmini}, {\ATM} will still be able to find the font, but
{\pscriptdrv} will not. (And Windows' algorithm for substituting the
`nearest' font invariably comes up with a font that no human would ever
consider `near' to the desired font in any way!)

The solution is to always use the {\ATM} Control Panel to `Remove' the font and then to `Add' it back again. Avoid hand editing {\atmini}.

\subsect{Hardwired Accents and the SAFESEAC Utility}

{\ATM} in Windows 95/98 has its own idea of where accents should be. This is
{\it only\/} a problem if (a) you use text fonts with something other than
default Windows {\ANSI} encoding, (b) you use ready-made accented characters
in the font (rather than explicitly overprinting base and accent character),
or (c) the font uses the Type~1 operator {\SEAC} (as most text fonts do
for the 58 `standard' accented characters).

{\SAFESEAC} is a {\yandy} utility that replaces/expands the problematic {\SEAC} (StandardEncoding Accented Character) operator. It produces a Type~1 font that circumvents the problem with {\ATM}'s hardwired accent positions, simply by not using {\SEAC} to call upon base characters and accents when constructing an accented character.

Fonts processed by {\SAFESEAC} have an additional advantage in providing a workaround for another bug, this one in PostScript interpreters. Most Adobe PostScript Level 1 printers have a bug relating to accented characters: they require that the base and accent characters actually appear in the encoding (that is, it is not sufficient that there is a ÛCharStringÛ for them). While this is not a major problem, it still is an issue if you wish to use an encoding such as IBM OEM, since this encoding does include accented characters, yet has no space for the accents themselves. (Hence Adobe PrestigeElite and Adobe LetterGothic are not useful for the `{\DOS} character set' even though these fixed width fonts do contain all of the required glyphs.)

One minor drawback to using {\SAFESEAC} is that the size of the resulting
{\PFB} file will increase slightly (typically between 6\% and 12\%). Another
is that some rendering algorithms may produce minor artifacts where base
character and `accent' overlap. For example, {\ATM} shows white instead of
black in the tiny area of overlap between the `C' and the `cedilla' in
`Ccedilla'.      
Fortunately, quality fonts have a separate  `Ccedilla' rather than
constructing it as a composite character. 

In some cases the hinting for an accent in a particular accented character may not be as good as it was in the original. This may happen when the original hint replacement code in an accent has to be removed. A warning message is issued when this occurs. Note that rendering of the original accent characters themselves is {\it not} affected. In any case, the effect of this on the accents in accented characters is normally small even on screen, and the effect on printed output is completely negligible.

To use {\SAFESEAC}, first convert the {\PFB} file to {\PFA} form using {\PFBtoPFA}. Then give {\SAFESEAC} the name of the {\PFA} file to be altered. The modified file is written into the current folder. Use {\PFAtoPFB} to convert the resulting {\PFA} file back into {\PFB} format, and install the new file in place of the original one.

{\SAFESEAC} can take wild-card arguments, so several {\PFA} files can be
`made safe' % modified 
at once. Just make sure there is enough disk space for them,
and some intermediate files.

\subsect{Character Positioning Options}

A final note on font- and display-related topics. When rendering characters
on any device of finite resolution, some compromises are necessary. The width
of a character when mapped to the finite raster is typically {\it not\/} an
integral number of pixels. The rasterized version of the character, however,
is an integral number of pixels wide. 

Consequently, when several rasterized characters are placed next to one another, the total number of pixels covered is typically not the rounded value of the sum of the true widths of the characters. At some point it becomes necessary to remove the accumulated error --- the difference between the rounded sum of the widths and the sum of the rounded widths. It is convenient to do this between words, where there is white space that can be shrunk or stretched as needed. 

Most of the time this works out quite well, since errors in different characters are random and positive errors tend to cancel negative errors. Problems occur when either (a) a single letter is repeated several times or (b) when using a fixed-width font. In these situations there is no opportunity for small errors of opposite sign to more or less cancel each other --- instead they relentlessly add up. Then, at certain resolutions, there may not be enough white space to absorb the error between words, and letters may collide (or large gaps may form, although these tend to be less objectionable).

The alternative: position each character separately by rounding the
accumulated sum of true character widths. While this avoids the problem, it
does not lead to results as pleasing in {\it normal\/} text, since there will
be adjustments between adjacent characters by one pixel that do not occur in
the first scheme. In addition, this scheme is inherently somewhat slower,
although on reasonably fast machines the difference is not noticable.

{\DVIWindo} gives you a choice between the two schemes for on-screen display,
through the `Favor Position' menu item in the program's `Fonts' menu. If
`Favor Position' is {\it checked}, each character is placed individually.
Positional offsets cannot accumulate. %, but output is slowed.  
If `Favor Position' is {\it unchecked}, sequences of characters are placed as
a group.  Positional offsets accumulate and are absorbed between words (and
where there is explicit kerning within a word).

For this feature to work as expected with fixed-width fonts, you may have to
list all of your fixed-width {\it text\/} fonts in the [Mono] section of
your {\atmini} file.  Note, too, that the `Favor Position' setting is
ignored for output to printers.  {\DVIPSONE} uses a different mechanism to
deal with the positioning of characters in printed output. 

You may also want to smooth screen font display.
Double click `My Computer,' then `View{\down}Folder Options,' 
and select the `View' tab. 
In `Visual Settings' check `Smooth Edges of Screen Fonts.'
This is for Windows~NT, the setting may be somewhere else in
other versions of Windows or Windows 95 Plus.

\section{Printing Issues}

The {\yandy} TeX System provides two means of printing: direct from
{\DVIWindo}, or --- for PostScript output --- via {\DVIPSONE} 
(either as the driver used from the print menu in
{\DVIWindo}, or as a command prompt utility). 
Each of these approaches has a variety of customization options. 

\subsect{DVIWindo printing versus DVIPSONE printing}

The two means of printing use very different code and so, not surprisingly,
have different properties and limitations. {\DVIPSONE} is specialized to
produce very efficient PostScript output, while {\DVIWindo} (indeed, Windows
in general) allows printing to any device for which a printer driver is
available. 

The specifics:

\blist
\item {\DVIPSONE} produces PostScript files that are much smaller than those produced by the Windows PostScript driver (by a factor of four to six in extreme cases).

\item {\DVIPSONE} produces PostScript files much faster than does the Windows PostScript driver. 

\item {\DVIPSONE} produces PostScript files that print much faster than those produced by the Windows PostScript driver.

\item {\DVIPSONE} uses sophisticated font management methods, such as partial
font downloading, to conserve printer memory. The Windows PostScript driver
downloads complete fonts. {\TeX} jobs typically call for many fonts and may
cause the printer to run out of virtual memory when printing using the
Windows {\PS} printer driver. 
\endlist

\noindent 
Symptoms: after a lot of apparent printer activity, no output is produced,
or only part of a page is printed, or only the first few pages of
a document are printed.
Download the {\ehandlerps} error handler ahead of time to check whether this
is what is in fact happening; see section 3.5.) 

\blist
\item {\DVIPSONE} produces resolution-independent output. The output produced by the Windows PostScript driver, on the other hand, is tuned for the selected printer.

\item {\DVIPSONE} produces code that is page independent --- pages
can be randomly permuted and removed from the PostScript file without
breaking the code. Page imposition software and software for printing
`$n$-up' on a page can use much simpler techniques when PostScript files
employ proper Document Structuring Conventions and are page
independent.

\item {\DVIPSONE} takes more care in character and rule placement than does the Windows PostScript driver.
\endlist

\noindent On the other hand:

\blist
\item Both {\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE} support text and rule color, and
monochrome image color Û\specialÛs. Note that on-screen display of colored
text is restricted (by Windows) to a fixed set of colors, where the number of
such colors depends on the `color depth' (bits per pixel) of the video
board/driver setting. Rule color is not restricted in this manner (since it
can make use of color `dithering').

\item Both {\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE} support Û\specialÛs for insertion of {\TIFF} files.

\item {\DVIPSONE} does not support Windows Metafile ({\WMF}) figures.
This is because WMF files are just recordings of sequences of
Windows GUI calls.

\item In addition to printing the document currently being viewed or
selected pages thereof (`Print\dots '), {\DVIWindo} can output the current
page in the current screen mapping mode (`Print View'). This allows you to
print enlarged and shifted views of a page. The program can also print the
character set of a selected font shown on screen, using the current screen
mapping mode (also from `Print View'). 

\endlist

\subsect{DVIPSONE Setup}

In {\DVIWindo}'s `Print\dots ' mode, the `Use DVIPSONE' checkbox lets you
tell the program either to use the appropriate Windows printer driver, or
else call upon {\DVIPSONE}, if available. (Obviously, to use {\DVIPSONE},
either the printer must be a PostScript device, or you must be attempting to
`print' PostScript output to a file.)     

The checkbox appears only if {\DVIWindo} can find {\DVIPSONE} --- % the case
which is the case if
either {\dvipsoneexe} is on your {\PATH}, or (better) if its preamble file
({\dvipreamenc}) and encoding vectors (Û*.vecÛ) are in the folders
pointed to by the {\PREPATH} and {\VECPATH} environment variables.
% respectively.

{\DVIPSONE}'s {\PIF} file ({\dvipsonepif}) is in 
ÛdvipsoneÛ sub-folder
% the same folder as {\dvipsoneexe} 
% (under Windows~95/98 and Windows NT 4.0, 
it will have a {\DOS} icon but its Û.pifÛ extension may not appear
(To change this, double click `My Computer,'
then `View{\down}Folder Options,' and  select the `View' tab.
Uncheck `Hide file extensions for known file types').
% Use the Windows {\PIF} editor (in Windows NT 3.5) or 

Right-click on the {\PIF} file and choose `Properties' 
% (in Windows~95/98 or NT 4.0) 
to modify it if necessary. `Program Filename' should
specify the executable (e.g., Ûc:\yandy\dvipsone\dvipsone.exeÛ). 
% Any 
Command
line arguments are ignored (since suitable command line arguments are passed
from {\DVIWindo}).

You can set up the `Display Usage' field in the {\PIF} file for running
`Normal' rather than `Full Screen.' In addition, you can choose to check the
`Close Window on Exit' box. The advantage of doing this is that no inactive
Windows remain after printing is finished. The disadvantage is that error
messages from {\DVIPSONE}, if any, disappear as soon as {\DVIPSONE} exits. It
is perhaps best to initially {\it not\/} close the window on exit (and to
manually close the resulting inactive windows). Once you've checked out the
linkage from {\DVIWindo} to {\DVIPSONE}, you can modify the {\PIF} file to
`Close Window on Exit.'

It is possible to do other things in Windows while {\DVIPSONE} is running, although speed will be impacted (as happens when the Windows print spooler is running). But avoid doing anything in {\DVIWindo} to the {\DVI} file you are trying to print. You can cancel printing from {\DVIPSONE} by typing Ctrl+C while the {\DVIPSONE} window is selected --- although this may not properly terminate the printing job on the printer (which is not a problem when {\DVIPSONE} runs directly in {\DOS}).

If you run {\DVIPSONE} from a command prompt in Windows~95/98 {\it and\/}
your PostScript printer is attached to a serial port (ÛCOM1Û or ÛCOM2Û), you
may want to use the {\MODEX} utility to increase the port's setting beyond
the 19,200 baud limit imposed by {\DOS}. The program takes arguments similar
to those taken by the {\DOS} Mode command; with no arguments, it reports the
current settings of ÛCOM1Û and ÛCOM2Û. Note that {\MODEX} affects the port
speed {\it only} for {\DOS} access.  

The {\MODEX} utility cannot be used in Windows~NT, since NT prevents
programs from directly accessing I/O hardware registers.
Fortunately, it also isn't normally needed in this case.

\subsect{Some Details of DVIPSONE Usage}

{\DVIPSONE} is controlled by command line flags and arguments. You can get a partial listing of these flags and arguments by typing Ûdvipsone -?Û. Less frequently used items are omitted from the resulting display to permit the list to be less than 25 lines long and fit on the screen without scrolling. For the complete list, see the Appendix.

Each command line flag or argument is preceded by Û-Û; the first argument {\it not\/} preceded by Û-Û is considered the name of the first {\DVI} file to be processed. A flag is a letter that stands on its own, while an argument is a letter followed by Û=Û and a name or a string of characters.

For example, to increase the verbosity of {\DVIPSONE}'s output, you can use the command line flag ÛvÛ; direction of the output to the second parallel port can be forced using the command line argument Ûd=LPT2Û. To do both while processing the file Ûtestfile.dviÛ, type

\beginlines
Ûdvipsone -v -d=LPT2 testfileÛ
\endlines

\noindent You can process any number of {\DVI} files in one invocation of {\DVIPSONE} --- the same command line flags and arguments apply to all of the files. In addition, you can use wildcard arguments. So, for example, to process all {\DVI} files in folder Ûc:\myfilesÛ whose names start with the word `chapter,' type

\beginlines
Ûdvipsone c:\myfiles\chapter*.dviÛ
\endlines

\noindent (Note that in this case the Û.dviÛ extension is needed so that {\DVIPSONE} will receive the full list of files. If you specify files {\it without\/} using wildcards, you may omit the extension.)

You can set up command line arguments and flags to be used when 
{\DVIPSONE} is called from {\DVIWindo} using 
`Preferences{\down}Command Line{\down}DVIPSONE' from {\DVIWindo}.
This preference is maintained in a
ÛDVIPSONE=...Û entry in the [Window] section of {\dviwindoini}. 
Items specified in this manner override any corresponding items in the
command line file (see next).

You can also avoid repeated typing of commonly used {\DVIPSONE} command line
arguments and flags by storing them in command line file {\dvipsonecmd} in
the {\DVIPSONE} subfolder of the main {\yandy} program folder. The format of
this file is the same as that of the command line (except that you may use
more than one line). % 96/Aug/26

Items on the command line override corresponding items in the command line file. Note also that because command line flags simply {\it toggle\/} the corresponding settings in {\DVIPSONE}, they do not have any effect if they appear an even number of times on the command line. As a result, you can cancel the effect of flags in the command line file by repeating them on the command line itself. You can also prefix any flag with Û1Û or Û0Û to force the flag on or off (this proves useful, for example, when you can't remember what is in {\dvipsonecmd}).

% A command line file can prove handy when using {\DVIPSONE} to print from
% {\DVIWindo}. But for operation in this mode you can {\it also\/} pass a set
% of command line flags and arguments to {\DVIPSONE} by placing them in a
% ÛDVIPSONE=...Û entry in the [Window] section of {\dviwindoini}. Items
% specified in this manner override any corresponding items in the command
% line file.

{\DVIPSONE} also employs a font substitution file. The standard version of
this file, {\standardsub}, resides in the Û\dvipsoneÛ subfolder of the main
{\yandy} program folder. 

One function of this file is to let {\DVIPSONE} know which fonts are
printer resident and hence need not be included in the {\PS} output.
%
If your printer contains fonts other than the basic 13 PostScript fonts ---
the Times-Roman, Helvetica and Courier families, plus Symbol --- you may want
to edit {\standardsub} or (better) create your own substitution file, either
from scratch or by modifying one of the additional substitution files. This
new substitution file can then be called in place of {\standardsub}, using
the Û-sÛ command line argument (see Appendix). (You can even invoke Û-sÛ
several times on a single command line, each time specifying a different
substitution file. The effect is the same as that attained by concatenating
all of the files into one large file.) % master

A sample line to specify a printer-resident font is

\beginlines
Ûtir Times-Roman *force* *reside*Û
\endlines

\noindent The first element is the filename, less underscores and extension; the second is the PostScript FontName ({\it not\/} the Face Name used in Windows menus); the last two elements tell {\DVIPSONE} not to download the font but instead assume that it is printer resident.

Note that if you claim a font is printer resident and it isn't, all instances of that font get `{\courier Couriered out}' upon output: the printer will substitute Courier for the font it thinks is missing
(without any kind of error message). % 96/Aug/26

Another function of this file is to replace one font with another upon
output. For example, if your {\DVI} output uses Ûmsbm6Û (from the AMS font
set) but you only have Ûmsbm7Û and Ûmsbm10Û, you can add this line to
{\standardsub} to deal with the problem:

\beginlines
Ûmsbm6 msbm7Û
\endlines

\noindent Alternatively, you can append {\amsfontssub} to {\standardsub}. One
of several additional substitution files provided with {\DVIPSONE}, it
contains this line plus a number of others designed to deal with similar problems.  

% Another function of the font substitution file is to ensure that the fonts
% permanently resident in your printer do not normally get downloaded as part
% of {\DVIPSONE}'s PostScript output.

\subsect{Troubleshooting Printing from DVIWindo}

{\DVIWindo} can run into two classes of problems when printing.

{\bf Display OK; printing occurs in the wrong font.} If the first and
subsequent pages come out in the wrong font (typically Courier), then the
fonts are not being downloaded properly. This may be because they have not
been installed using {\ATM}, or, more likely, because the PostScript driver
doesn't know they are there. This can happen if you install the printer
driver {\it after\/} loading the fonts using {\ATM}. Remove the fonts using
the {\ATM} Control Panel, then reinstall them. Check that the fonts are
listed in the appropriate section of the {\winini} file. If printing with
{\DVIPSONE}, also check that the {\PSFONTS} environment variable in
{\dviwindoini} includes the folder where the fonts' {\PFB} files reside 
(typically Ûc:\psfontsÛ or Ûc:\winnt\fontsÛ).

If the first page prints correctly but subsequent pages use the wrong font (typically Courier), your printer driver thinks there is not enough virtual memory in the printer. The driver then tries to compensate by wrapping each page in a Ûsave/restoreÛ pair, which does not work, since {\pscriptdrv} output is {\it not\/} page-independent. With this scheme, fonts defined on one page are not available on another. You can check `Clear memory per page' (buried deep in the printer's Properties options), but that slows printing considerably. It is usually better to try to increase the amount of virtual memory the driver thinks your printer has (also via Properties).

{\bf Display OK; some characters print incorrectly.} On-screen display is
handled by {\ATM}, as is printing to non-PostScript printers. So in
this case it is next to impossible for different fonts or different font
metric information to be used for printing than for on-screen display
(except in the case of buggy HP {\PCL} printer drivers in Windows~95 ---
see Ûwin95.txtÛ).

In the case of PostScript printers, printing is instead handled by {\pscriptdrv} or a similar PostScript driver. {\ATM} and {\pscriptdrv} both refer to the {\PFM} and {\PFB} files but interpret those files in different ways. If the interpretations don't agree, the printed result is usually OK but on-screen display is not. However, the reverse can also occur.

The Windows PostScript printer driver bases its selection of a {\PFM} file for a font, and the {\PFB} file to download for that {\PFM}, on the Windows Face Name. This can lead to hidden problems, since the listing in {\winini} includes {\it only\/} font file names, and does not contain any reference to either the Windows Face Name or the PostScript FontName (unlike {\atmini}, which is organized around Face Names).

The most common source of this problem is two fonts with the same Face Name. Typically {\pscriptdrv} uses the first one in its ÛsoftfontsÛ list, ignoring any others. {\ATM} instead uses the most recently installed name, ignoring older versions. The best way to diagnose this type of problem is to check the association in {\atmini} between Face Name and font file name, then check in the appropriate Û.fsfÛ file to see what {\pscriptdrv} is using. (This file is binary, but its listings of Windows Face Names and font file names are in {\ASCII}.)

Seeing two fonts with the same Face Name usually results from not removing a
font in the {\ATM} Control Panel before installing a hard-reencoded version
of that font. Another cause is the tendency of some `clone' font vendors to
supply fonts that use a different PostScript FontName but the same Windows
Face Name as the original. A third cause is a potential conflict between a
newly installed font with the same Face Name as that of one of the fonts for
which {\pscriptdrv} contains wired-in {\PFM} files. (Normally this last
point should not be an issue, since {\pscriptdrv} is {\it supposed\/} to
refer to external {\PFM} files first, only resorting to its built-in {\PFM}
files if it can't find what it needs elsewhere.) 

Note that {\ATM}~4.0 does not maintain {\atmini}, instead using
a file called Ûatmreg.atmÛ in your Windows folder. 
Use the ÛatmreganÛ utility 
in ÛutilÛ sub-folder of the ÛyandyÛ folder
to show the contents of that file:

\beginlines
Ûc:\yandy\util\atmreganÛ
\endlines

\subsect{Additional Troubleshooting for PostScript Printers}

If your PostScript printer is connected to a parallel port, type the
following test input at a command prompt:

\beginlines
Ûcopy CON LPT1:Û \angi{Enter}
ÛshowpageÛ \angi{Ctrl+D} \angi{Ctrl+Z}
\endlines

\noindent If the printer is properly connected, it should eject a blank page.

If the printer is connected to serial port ÛCOM1Û or ÛCOM2Û, type

\beginlines
ÛmodeÛ \angi{port name}
\endlines

\noindent or

\beginlines
ÛmodeÛ \angi{port name} Û/statusÛ
\endlines

\noindent to check that the proper ÛPRINTER BUSYÛ handling has been set up. You should see ÛRETRY=BÛ for the specified port. If not, add a ÛMODEÛ line to your Ûautoexec.batÛ line (e.g. ÛMODE lpt1:,,BÛ);

Suspect flow control problems if only the first few pages of a document print correctly from a serially connected PostScript printer. Typical symptoms are overruns (parts of the file mysteriously disappear) or when the printer is receiving data (as reported by its flashing display) but does not print anything or prints garbled output.

You can download {\ehandlerps} (in the Û\psÛ subfolder of the main {\yandy} program folder) to help diagnose these and related problems. Send it to the printer {\it before} the offending PostScript file (you may have to reboot the printer first). If the `offending command' it reports is ÛioerrorÛ, there may be a mismatch between printer and port settings for communications parameters or handshaking.
To download a file, just use the {\DOS} {\COPY} command. % 96/Aug/26

The error handler remains printer resident and provides a page containing detailed analysis of the state of the PostScript interpreter whenever an error occurs. By default, it produces hard copy, but if the printer is attached to a serial port, the error handler can also be configured to send its information back to the computer, where the {\SERIAL} utility (see section 3.6.4) can show the error information on screen and also send it to a log file.

Hardcopy output from {\ehandlerps} is selected by the line

\beginlines
Ûshowflag true defÛ
\endlines

\noindent while serial port output is selected by

\beginlines
Ûprintflag true defÛ
\endlines

\noindent To change the default, read {\ehandlerps} into an editor as a plain {\ASCII} file and search for the two lines setting ÛshowflagÛ and ÛprintflagÛ; change ÛfalseÛ to ÛtrueÛ as appropriate and save the file.

The test files provided in the Û\dvipsone\debugÛ subfolder of the main {\yandy} program folder might also prove useful. The files are a sequence of increasingly complex PostScript jobs. If the first few print without error but the last few do not, you may have a printer with an interpreter that is not completely compatible with Adobe Type~1 fonts.

\subsect{Useful Printer Utilities}

\subsub{Using DOWNLOAD} It is normally better to rely upon {\DVIPSONE}'s advanced font management techniques than to download fonts permanently. If you nevertheless need to do so, use the utility program {\DOWNLOAD}. This program can also be used to reboot the printer and to cause the printer to output a sorted listing of fonts in its ÛFontDictionaryÛ. For some printers with a hard disk, you can also use {\DOWNLOAD} to download fonts to that disk

{\DOWNLOAD} uses the following command line flags and arguments:

\blist
\item Û?Û --- Show short usage summary.

\item ÛbÛ --- Reboot printer (to clear virtual memory). (Some non-Adobe PostScript interpreters do not support clearing of virtual memory without power cycling.)

\item ÛdÛ --- Destination. Output will go to the designated device (ÛPRNÛ, ÛLPT1Û, ÛLPT2Û, ÛLPT3Û, ÛAUXÛ, ÛCOM1Û, ÛCOM2Û or a file).

\item ÛfÛ --- Print sorted font dictionary on printer.

\item ÛhÛ --- Load the specified font file to hard disk. (Since hard disk I/O functions tend to be printer specific, however, it is usually best to use the downloading program supplied with the printer instead.)

\item ÛiÛ --- Read PostScript program from keyboard and send it to printer. (Keyboard input is terminated with a Ctrl+Z.)

\item ÛkÛ --- Use the specified password (default is `0,' the factory default on most PostScript printers.)

\item ÛpÛ --- Load the specified font file `permanently' to virtual memory.

\item ÛvÛ --- Verbose mode.
\endlist

\noindent When output goes to a serial port, {\DOWNLOAD} assumes that the printer is set for hardware flow control. If the destination argument is omitted, the output is sent to a file in the current folder with the same name as the {\PFB} file, but with extension Û.pfaÛ. {\DOWNLOAD} can be used in this way to convert binary {\PFB}-format font files into hexadecimal {\PFA} format, which can be sent to the printer later using the {\DOS} {\PRINT} or {\COPY} commands).

\subsub{Using TWOUP} Because the output produced by {\DVIPSONE} conforms to
Adobe's Document Structuring Conventions for {\PS} % PostScript 
files and is page independent, it is
possible to process such files to select or rearrange pages, print two pages
side by side on the same physical sheet of paper, and so on. Some of these
transformations are enabled by the use of outline fonts, which can be freely
rescaled. 

The {\TWOUP} utility illustrates some of the possibilities. For example, it allows you to print two pages next to each other on the same piece of paper ---  saving trees when you're reviewing drafts. It can also be used to generate pages in signature order --- ready for `saddle-back' stapling or stitching. 

The output of {\TWOUP} also conforms to the Document Structuring Conventions,
and so can be passed through the program a second time to print four logical
pages on one physical page (and so on). (Note that {\TWOUP} can be used to
process any {\PS} file that is page independent and satisfies the Document
Structuring Conventions, not just the output of {\DVIPSONE}.)

To avoid confusion, call the pages in the input file `logical' pages and the
pages in the output file `physical' pages. Further, if the document contains
$m$ pages, let $n=\lceil m/4 \rceil$, that is, $4n - 3 < m \le 4n$. The
command line flags and arguments are: 

\blist
\item Û?Û --- Show short usage summary.

\item ÛaÛ --- Invert alternating output pages.

\item ÛcÛ --- Number of copies (the default is 1).

\item ÛdÛ --- Destination. Output gets sent to the designated device (ÛPRNÛ, ÛLPT1Û, ÛLPT2Û, ÛLPT3Û, ÛAUXÛ, ÛCOM1Û, ÛCOM2Û or a file). If this argument is omitted, the output gets sent to a file in the current folder with the same name as the input file, but with extension Û.ps2Û (or Û.ps4Û, and so on).

\item ÛeÛ --- Insert blank logical pages to ensure that even pages are always on the right. (This is useful if the `page numbers' in the PostScript file are off by one from the actual page numbers.)

\item ÛgÛ --- Print the `top' sides of signature-order pages (that is, only the odd numbered physical pages). This is useful for duplex printing (implies ÛsÛ).

\item ÛhÛ --- Print the `bottom' sides of signature-order pages (that is, only the even numbered physical pages) (implies ÛsÛ).

\item ÛiÛ --- Invert all pages (rotate 180 degrees in the horizontal plane).

\item ÛJÛ --- Flip state of Ctrl+D flag (i.e., whether Ctrl+D is at end of output). Normally Ctrl+D is appended when output to printer, but not to file.

\item ÛlÛ --- Specify logical page size. The default is ÛletterÛ. Other supported values are ÛnoteÛ, ÛlegalÛ, ÛfolioÛ, ÛledgerÛ, ÛtabloidÛ, ÛexecutiveÛ, ÛquartoÛ, Ûa3Û, Ûa4Û, Ûa5Û, Ûb4Û and Ûb5Û.

\item ÛmÛ --- Magnify the logical pages using the specified relative scale
factor (the default is Û1.0Û). {\TWOUP} normally uses a scale factor that
assures that the logical page fits into half of the physical page. There will
be a lot of white space on the output page if the logical pages have a
significant margin and the aspect ratio of half of the physical page doesn't
match the aspect ratio of the logical page. In this case it may be helpful to
increase the scale. The precomputed scale factor is multiplied by the scale
factor specified on the command line. 

\item ÛMÛ --- Magnify the logical pages using the specified absolute scale factor (the default is Û1.0Û).

\item ÛnÛ --- Do not trip out when meeting Û%%TrailerÛ or Û%%EOFÛ at top nesting level.

\item ÛoÛ --- Insert blank logical pages to ensure that odd pages are always on the right. (The default is to print pages in the order they appear in the input file, without concern for whether the page numbers are even or odd.)

\item ÛOÛ --- Tell printer to use duplex mode (if it has one).

\item ÛpÛ --- Specify physical page size (default ÛletterÛ; see ÛlÛ for other allowed values).

\item ÛrÛ --- Reverse order of printing (for saddle-back stapling). You can use ÛgÛ and ÛhÛ to print on both sides of the paper. After printing the `top' of each page, load the paper into the paper tray upside down (but without rotating it in the horizontal plane) to print the `bottom' of each page. {\it Some\/} printer engines might also require using ÛrÛ with either ÛgÛ or ÛhÛ (but not both) to avoid the need to manually reverse the order of the sheets before printing the second side.

\item ÛsÛ --- Print pages in signature order, for saddle-back stapling. In
this case, the first physical page printed contains logical page $4n$ on the
left and logical page 1 on the right. The next physical page contains logical
page 2 on the left and logical page $4n-1$ on the right, and so on. The last
physical page printed contains logical page $2n$ on the left and logical page
$2n+1$ on the right. The staples holding the resulting booklet together will
be visible when the booklet is open on the last physical page printed. 

\item ÛTÛ --- Tell printer to tumble (in duplex mode) if it can do so.

\item ÛvÛ --- Verbose mode

\item ÛwÛ --- Prolog file to be inserted.

\item ÛxÛ --- Shift the right logical page {\it right}, and the left logical page {\it left}, by the specified amount (in points). Positive values increase the gutter width. If ÛxÛ is repeated in a single command line, the first instance applies to the left page, the second to the right page.

\item ÛyÛ --- Shift both logical pages {\it up} on the physical page by the specified amount (in points).

\item ÛzÛ --- Use the second number in Û%%Page:Û comments as the page number rather than the first. Normally {\TWOUP} uses the first number appearing in the Û%%Page:Û document structuring comments as `page number.' Output from {\DVIPSONE} uses the first number for {\TeX}'s Ûcounter[0]Û. (In some documents the first `number' may be an alphanumeric label instead.) The second number is just the page count within the PostScript file.
\endlist

\subsub{Using PKTOPS} {\DVIPSONE} normally uses only Adobe Type~1 outline
fonts, because inclusion of bitmapped fonts makes the PostScript output
resolution dependent. However, since some fonts are not available in outline
form, {\DVIPSONE} also provides a mechanism for using bitmapped fonts. 

Computer Modern fonts in bitmapped form are usually available in {\PK}
(packed) format, which is not suitable for use on a PostScript printer. The
{\PKTOPS} utility generates an Adobe Type~3 font from a {\PK} font file;
{\DVIPSONE} can use the resulting Type~3 bitmap font file. It should be
placed somewhere on the font search path. ({\DVIPSONE} can use Type~3 font
files properly {\it only\/} if they are in the special form produced by
{\PKTOPS}. Other fonts get included in the output without modification ---
and without guarantees!)

A Type~3 font file produced by {\PKTOPS} can also be downloaded to the
printer before the PostScript job calling for that font goes to the printer.
In that case, the fact that this font is to be treated as printer resident
should be noted in the font substitution file.

Ideally, the resolution (dpi) of the {\PK} font should match that of the
printer. If you cannot obtain an exact match, try to find a {\PK} file made
at a resolution that is some integer multiple of the printer's resolution.
And if that is not possible, use the {\it highest\/} resolution available.
(If the resolution of the bitmap font does not match that of the printer,
the output tends to look somewhat heavier and a bit jagged, although it {\it
will\/} print at the correct size.) 

{\PKTOPS} can process multiple {\PK} files in one invocation --- all files listed on the command line get processed under control of the specified flags and arguments:

\blist
\item Û?Û --- Show short usage summary.

\item ÛcÛ --- Insert comments in output file.

\item ÛdÛ --- Destination. Output goes to the designated device (ÛPRNÛ, ÛLPT1Û, ÛLPT2Û, ÛLPT3Û, ÛAUXÛ, ÛCOM1Û, ÛCOM2Û). If the destination is omitted, output goes to a file in the current folder with the same name as the {\PK} file, but with extension Û.psÛ.

\item ÛlÛ --- Do not force upper case font name.

\item ÛvÛ --- Verbose mode.
\endlist

\noindent Normally bitmaps for all characters get converted. In some situations you may want to limit the size of the output file by including only those characters actually needed:

\blist
\item ÛaÛ --- Include characters in Û"Û\angi{string}Û"Û

\item ÛrÛ --- Include bitmaps for characters in the range \angi{start}--\angi{end}.

\item ÛxÛ --- Include bitmaps for the characters specified by the given hexadecimal string (the default is all characters). The bits of the first character in the string indicate whether the characters from 0 to 3 should be included, and so on.
\endlist

\noindent Arguments ÛaÛ and ÛrÛ may be repeated.

To download an Adobe Type~3 font file produced by {\PKTOPS}, either select the appropriate destination using the command line flag ÛdÛ, or send the resulting file to the printer as any ordinary PostScript file, using the {\DOS} {\PRINT} or {\COPY} commands.

The resulting font file is set up for `permanent' downloading to the printer. It is possible to modify the font file to provide for temporary downloading by commenting out a specially marked line of PostScript code at the beginning of the file.

\subsub{Using SERIAL} Some very old PostScript printers do not provide
hardware flow control. With them, you must use a downloader for all but very
short files, since {\DOS} does not directly support software flow control.
In fact, the {\DOS} {\PRINT} or {\COPY} commands cannot be used, and output
from {\DVIPSONE}, {\DOWNLOAD}, {\PKTOPS} and {\TWOUP} cannot be sent
directly to such a printer. 

In such situations turn to {\SERIAL}, which uses software flow control. ({\SERIAL} actually supports both hardware ({\DTRDSR}) and software ({\XONXOFF}) flow control --- but is not needed if hardware flow control is available, since output can then be sent directly to the printer from {\DVIPSONE} and the utility programs, or by using the {\DOS} {\PRINT} and {\COPY} commands.)

The optional command line flags and arguments are:

\blist
\item Û?Û --- Show short usage summary.

\item ÛdÛ --- Send the output to the specified destination (the default is ÛAUXÛ, also known as ÛCOM1Û).

\item ÛeÛ --- Do not send end-of-job (Ctrl+D) to the printer.

\item ÛlÛ --- Do not write a log file (Ûprinter.logÛ).

\item ÛpÛ --- Do not get port addresses from machine (use standard addresses).

\item ÛqÛ --- Assume specified interrupt request number rather than default for port.

\item ÛtÛ --- Time to wait for end-of-job (default 60 sec). Zero means wait indefinitely.

\item ÛvÛ --- Verbose mode.

\item ÛwÛ --- Do not wait for end-of-job (Ctrl+D) from printer.
\endlist

\noindent Not waiting for the end-of-job indicator from the printer allows you to continue using the computer as soon as the file has been sent to the printer, but means that any error messages sent back (by Ûehandler.psÛ, for example~) will be lost.

Note that in order to use software flow control it is necessary to access the serial port directly, that is, to bypass both {\DOS} and {\BIOS}. This means that {\SERIAL} may not work on some PC clones that do not use the standard hardware interface for the serial port. (The ÛqÛ argument may help in this regard.)

This utility can also not be used on systems that prevent programs from
accessing hardware directly --- such as Windows~NT. % 96/Aug/26

\subsub{Using CHANGED} The {\CHANGED} utility allows you to (a) extract the pages of output that have changed with respect to a previous output run, and (b) extract specified page ranges and reorder pages in a PostScript file. It's designed for use on output produced by {\DVIPSONE}, but can also be used on PostScript files produced by other programs, provided those files are {\DSC} (Document Structuring Convention) compliant and page independent (i.e., there are no font definitions in the middle of a file).

To print only pages that have changed, {\CHANGED} compares two output files and copies the pages that show differences to a third output file, Ûchanged.psÛ, which it deposits in the current folder. The command line for this function is:

\beginlines
Ûchanged [-v] Û\angi{old-PS-File} \angi{new-PS-File}
\endlines

\noindent The two PostScript files are not treated symmetrically. The header in the output file is copied from the new file; the header in the old file is ignored. Pages that appear in the new file but not in the old one are copied to the output. Pages that appear in the old file but not in the new file are ignored.

An example of the syntax used to extract and/or reorder pages is:

\beginlines
Ûchanged -v -P=3-7,43-39,5,63 myfile.psÛ
\endlines

\noindent A 1-page range is indicated by a single number (e.g., 5 in this example). `Inverted' page ranges (e.g., 43-39) yield pages in reverse order, and a particular page may appear more than once (e.g., page 5 again).

The numbers denote physical (sequential) pages within the file (the second
number in the PostScript Û%%Page: Û comment). 
Use ÛpÛ instead of ÛPÛ to instead deal with logical page numbers (the first
number in Û%%Page: Û). 
As usual, there are potential problems if logical page numbers are repeated
in the source file. In this case {\CHANGED} picks the first page with a given
page number. 

Pages are output in the order specified in the page range list. Use the command line argument ÛfÛ to instead output pages in the order that they appear in the source file. You can use other delimiters, such as a plus sign or a semicolon, instead of comma. (This is convenient when invoking {\CHANGED} using a batch file, since commas break up the list into separate batch file arguments.)

\section{{\TeX} Issues}

\subsect{Working With Different Keyboards}

Using {\TeX}'s normal Û\accentÛ mechanism for accented characters
(i.e. is writing Û\"AÛ for {\"A} and Û\c CÛ for {\c C})
can become
tedious when you are working in a language that uses a lot of accented
characters. In that case, it is usually easier to just enter the accented
characters directly from the keyboard. (Conversely, if you use {\TeX} only
for English text, you can just skip this section!) 

There are several strategies for achieving direct entry of accented
characters; which is best depends on (i) what type of editor you use, (ii)
how your keyboard is encoded, (iii) how your fonts are set up, and (iv)
whether or not those fonts contain ready-made accented characters
(Please also refer to Ûkeyboard.txtÛ in Ûdoc-miscÛ).

When you press a key on the keyboard, a character code number gets entered into your {\TeX} source file. What code number you get depends on the encoding used by the software (i.e., operating system plus editor) when it reads the signals from the keyboard. If you are using a Windows editor, you typically have the keyboard mapped to produce character codes corresponding to Windows {\ANSI} encoding (see file Ûansinew.vecÛ, in the Û\fonts\encodingÛ subfolder of the main {\yandy} program folder). And if you are using a {\DOS} editor, you typically get character codes corresponding to a particular {\DOS} `code page.' In English-speaking countries this is usually code page 437 (see file Ûdos437.vecÛ), while in many countries where writing can be represented using the Latin 1 character set it is instead code page 850 (see file Ûdos850.vecÛ). (You can control which code page is loaded from the command prompt via the Mode command.)

The keyboard mapping may or may not be the same as the mapping used on the
output side for your fonts. Text fonts installed `out of the box' using
{\ATM}, for example, are typically set up for Windows {\ANSI}.

% Used straight from {\DOS}, such fonts may instead be set up for Adobe
% StandardEncoding (see file Ûstandard.vecÛ).
%
The {\yandy} TeX System provides several ways of dealing with differences between keyboard encoding and font encoding:

{\bf Keyboard mapping matches font encoding.} This is the easiest of all, since (virtually) nothing needs to be done --- no remapping of character codes is required. This is what happens if you use a Windows editor to create your source files, and if you also do not reencode the fonts (i.e., you are using Windows {\ANSI}). However, you may need Û\input ansiacceÛ in your source file to compensate for plain {\TeX} and {\LaTeX}'s hardwired assumptions about accents and special characters.

This method cannot be used with Computer Modern ({\CM}) fonts, however, because they use their own unique encoding (TeX Text) and do not contain the `standard' accented characters --- at least not normally in encoded positions (the {\CM} fonts from {\yandy} {\it do\/} have these extra characters, as noted below).

{\bf Keyboard mapping different, accented characters available.} If the keyboard mapping is different from the font encoding, but the font does contain pre-built accented characters, you can use {\TeX}'s Ûxchr[]Û character code permuting table, which provides the mapping from {\TeX}'s internal character codes to those used in the source document. The {\it inverse\/} of this table (Ûxord[]Û) translates input. Such a table is a plain {\ASCII} file, and can be specified on the {\yandy} TeX command line (using the Û-xÛ argument).

A typical example is a case where a {\DOS} editor is used to create the
source files but the fonts are set up for Windows {\ANSI}. In this case, the
internal representation should match Windows {\ANSI}, and the Ûxchr[]Û table
should describe the mapping {\it from\/} Windows {\ANSI} {\it to\/} the
{\DOS} code page in use. {\TeX} then performs the inverse mapping on input.

Sample files are provided in the Û\yandytex\keyboardÛ subfolder of the main {\yandy} program folder: Ûdos437wn.mapÛ is appropriate when the editor uses {\DOS} code page 437 (English), and Ûdos850wn.mapÛ is appropriate when {\DOS} code page 850 (Latin 1) is in use. You can use the {\yandy} utility Ûtranslat.exeÛ (in the Û\utilÛ subfolder) to create additional tables. For example, the two Û*.mapÛ files just described were made using

\beginlines
Ûtranslat ansinew dos437Û
\endlines

\noindent and

\beginlines
Ûtranslat ansinew dos850Û
\endlines

\noindent respectively, with redirection of the on-screen output to a file in
each case (using Û>Û 
on the command line). Some editing may be required to fine-tune tables
created in this fashion. Note the apparent inverse order of the arguments.
This is because the Ûxchr[]Û array translates {\it from\/} {\TeX}'s internal
representation {\it to\/} the keyboard mapping.

The Computer Modern text fonts from {\yandy} do include the 58 `standard'
accented/composite characters found in most Type~1 fonts. But they are not in
the TeX Text encoding. So one option here is to reencode these fonts to make
the accented characters accessible (see Appendix, section 6.9). If you use
this approach, you will be incompatible with other users of {\CM} fonts, but
can then simply use the method described here.  You will also lose access to
the upright upper-case Greek letters which are hidden in the {\CM} roman text
font! % 96/Aug/26
%
So we recommend the `European Modern' (EM) fonts instead.

{\bf Keyboard mapping different, accented characters not available.} A different strategy is required when merely permuting the numbers 0--255 does not do the job --- as is the case when the fonts you're using lack ready-made accented and composite characters. For dealing with accented characters that appear in the input but that do not occur in the fonts, {\yandy} TeX provides a `keyboard replacement' table mechanism (the Û-kÛ command line argument). This allows you to automatically expand accented character codes in the input file into {\TeX} commands for constructed accented characters: character code 132 may become Û\"aÛ and 128 may be replaced with Û\c CÛ, for example.

Sample files for this purpose are in the Û\yandytex\keyboardÛ subfolder: As with the Û*.mapÛ character mapping tables, Ûdos437.keyÛ would be used with {\DOS} code page 437; Ûdos850.keyÛ with {\DOS} code page 850, etc.

Each line in a keyboard replacement file contains the character code number
and the replacement string, separated by white space. Use Û"..."Û to quote
the replacement text if it contains white space (useful for Û\c CÛ and Û\c
cÛ, for example). Normally a replacement string would consist of plain
{\ASCII} characters (codes 32--126), but it can also invoke
accented characters or arbitrary {\TeX} control sequences.
% although it may also use accent
% characters directly in order to trigger pseudo ligatures in the {\TFM}
% files (e.g., replacing `dieresis' followed by `a' with `adieresis').

{\bf Keyboard mapping different, accented characters not available
(alternative).} 
Another way to deal with this case is to have {\TeX} itself do the remapping,
by making the characters `active.' Simply Û\input meta_437Û (for code page
437) or Û\input meta_850Û (for code page 850). This capability is similar to
that provided by the Textures Ûoption_keyÛ {\TeX} source file and by the
{\LaTeXe} package ÛinputencÛ. 
%
See also Ûkeyboard.txtÛ in the Ûyandy\doc-miscÛ folder.

Note that proper hyphenation of text containing accented characters is not
possible if the fonts do not contain ready-made accented characters. 
% 96/Aug/26 
This is a problem with Computer Modern (CM) fonts.

One solution is to use the European Modern (EM) fonts instead.

\subsect{Some Details of {\yandyBold} TeX Usage}

Like {\DVIPSONE} and {\yandy}'s various utility programs, {\yandy} TeX accepts both arguments and flags on the command line. Flags have the form Û-Û\angi{value}, and arguments look like Û-Û\angi{arg}Û=Û\angi{value}. In an argument, you can use a space instead of Û=Û on the command line (which proves convenient when setting up batch files).
%
A complete list of {\yandy} TeX's command line flags and arguments appears 
in the Appendix. 

You can set up command line arguments and flags to be used when 
Ûyandytex.exeÛ is called from {\DVIWindo} using 
`Preferences{\down}Command Line{\down}Y\&Y TeX' from {\DVIWindo}.
This preference is maintained in the
ÛTeX=...Û entry in the [Window] section of {\dviwindoini}. 
Items specified in this manner override any corresponding items in the
command line file (see next).

If you frequently use command line items, you can (i) put them in
the batch file {\texbat} (in the Û\yandytexÛ subfolder of the main {\yandy}
program folder) so that they are in effect when that batch file is invoked,
(ii) put them in {\DVIWindo}'s `TeX' menu replacement text so they are in
effect when you call {\yandy} TeX from the `TeX' menu, or (iii) add a
ÛTeX=...Û item to the [Window] section of {\dviwindoini} (which also takes
effect when calling {\yandy} TeX from the `TeX' menu).

Another alternative is to set up a command file, {\yandytexcmd}, containing
the required flags and arguments. Anything not preceded by a Û-Û (or Û/Û)
gets ignored. A typical file might look like

\beginlines
Ûc:\yandy\yandytex\yandytex.exe -v -L -H=8Û
\endlines

\noindent Multiple lines are permitted. {\yandy} TeX searches for this file
first in the current folder, then in the Û\yandytexÛ subfolder. There is no
warning message if such a file is not found  
(since it is not an error to have no such file). % 96/Aug/26
Command line flags and arguments in this file take effect {\it before\/} those supplied on the command line, so the command line takes precedence in the event of a conflict.

As described in the main manual, typing Ctrl+Z when {\yandy} TeX is waiting
for a file name input performs an `Emergency Exit' from the program.
% Likewise, 
Typing ÛnulÛ as the file name causes the program to read an empty
file --- which in some cases may be appropriate, or at least
keep {\TeX} going a little longer emitting hopefully
helpful error messages.

To interrupt program operation % in other states, 
type Ctrl+C. If input characters are buffered up,
you may see no immediate response, in which case try Ctrl+Break. {\yandy} TeX
is not always in a state in which it is responsive to such interruptions ---
in that case, try Ctrl+C several times in succession to abort the current
operation (and possibly also leave the output in a messy state).

\subsect{Handling Graphics in the {\yandyBold} TeX System}

\subsub{Some Notes on TPIC $\backslash$specials} {\TPIC} Û\specialÛs are used by various {\TeX} macro packages (such as {\eepicsty}) to draw simple shapes in a device independent way. Several {\DVI} processors, including {\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE}, support these Û\specialÛs --- a complete list of which appears in the Appendix, section 6.8.
One advantage of {\TPIC} over {\LaTeX}'s picture environment is that there
are no constraints on direction and length of arrows. % 96/Aug/26

One use of the Û\specialÛs depends on accumulating a polygonal path, then `stroking' this path (using solid, dashed or dotted lines, or even quadratic splines) and/or `filling' the shape obtained by closing the path. You can also draw circles, circular disks, ellipses aligned with the coordinate axes and elliptical arcs.

Consult the file Ûtpictest.texÛ, in the Û\texinputÛ subfolder of the main
{\yandy} program folder, for some examples of the commands' use.  
% And 
When using the Û\specialÛs, keep the following points in mind:

\blist
\item The origin of the coordinate system is at {\TeX}'s current point --- $x$ increasing to the right and $y$ increasing downward.

\item {\TeX}'s current point is {\it not\/} disturbed by {\TPIC} Û\specialÛs (so this is {\it not\/} a way to displace text typeset in {\TeX}).

\item Lengths, widths and coordinates are in milli-inches (0.001 in.) Only integers are permitted. An exception is the specification of dash length and dot interval (in inches).

\item Angles are in radians, clockwise from the horizontal. (Angles are allowed to be reals, of course.)

\item Gray levels lie between 0.0 and 1.0, with 0 being white and 1 black. (Note that this is reversed from common usage.)

\item `Stroke' means draw a solid, dashed or dotted line, or a spline, with a pen of specified width. Strokes are always black.

\item `Fill' means fill a closed shape with a specified gray level. If no gray level is explicitly specified, black is assumed. The shape gets implicitly closed if it is not closed already.

\item Stroking and/or filling a polygonal path resets it. The next path-accumulating command starts a new path.

\item Explicitly setting the gray level implies that the next shape is to be filled. The request to fill a shape is reset after the shape is filled; to fill the next shape, a gray level must be specified again.

\item Some implementations have limits on how many lines a polygonal path may contain (600 typically).
\endlist

\subsub{Insertion of EPS figures} As noted elsewhere, the {\yandy} TeX System
accommodates insertion of {\EPS} images and/or figures via the most commonly
used Û\specialÛs defined for this purpose. (There is {\it no\/} notational
standardization for {\EPS} file insertion across the various dialects of
{\TeX}.) Following is a discussion of those Û\specialÛs. 

{\bf Important note:} these Û\specialÛs are the low-level mechanism; 
use the {\LaTeXe} ÛgraphicsÛ or ÛgraphicxÛ packages instead, if possible. 
In plain {\TeX} use Ûepsf.texÛ, and in {\LaTeX}~2.09 use Ûpsfig.styÛ.
Actually, we have modified these to deal correctly with {\EPS} files
with previews.  
The modified files are called Ûepsfsafe.texÛ and Ûpsfigfx.styÛ.

The following discussion is pretty much only for situations
where you are dealing with `legacy' {\TeX} source material.

{\bf Method 1} --- Scheme supported by Tomas Rokicki's {\DVIPS}, used by one
dialect of Trevor Darrell's {\PSFIG} macro package:

\beginlines
Û\special{ps::[begin]Û \angi{w} \angi{h} \angi{xll} \angi{yll} \angi{xur} \angi{yur} ÛstartTexFig}Û
Û\special{ps: plotfileÛ \angi{eps-file}Û}Û
Û\special{ps::[end] endTexFig}Û
\endlines

\noindent  The six arguments are the desired width and height of the inserted figure on the page, and the lower left and upper right corner of its bounding box, respectively. All of these quantities are in {\DVI} units (that is, `scaled' points, 65,536 per pica point, of which there are 72.27 per inch). Note that letter case is significant in the words ÛstartTexFigÛ and ÛendTexFigÛ.

The figure is scaled so as to map the bounding box into a rectangle of the specified width and height. The {\it upper left-hand\/} corner of this rectangle is placed at {\TeX}'s current point.

Note that scaling may be different in the horizontal and vertical directions, which may lead to unexpected results. Isotropic scaling can be forced by making the aspect ratio of the rectangle defined by the requested width and height match the aspect ratio of the rectangle defined by the bounding box (This is usually taken care of by the macro package being used).

Clipping to the rectangle defined by the bounding box may be called for by inserting the line:

\beginlines
Û\special{ps:: doclip}Û
\endlines

\noindent after the ÛstartTexFigÛ line. There can be several Ûps: plotfileÛ lines between the ÛstartTexFigÛ and ÛendTexFigÛ lines, making it possible to insert prolog and postlog files for a particular figure.

{\bf Method 2} --- A variant on the previous theme for Stephan v. Bechtolsheim's {\DVITWOPS}, generated by another dialect of Trevor Darrell's {\PSFIG} macro package:

\beginlines
Û\special{ps: psfiginit}Û
Û\special{ps: literalÛ \angi{w} \angi{h} \angi{xll} \angi{yll} \angi{xur} \angi{yur} ÛstartTexFig}Û
Û\special{ps: includeÛ \angi{eps-file}Û}Û
Û\special{ps: literal "endTexFig "}Û
\endlines

\noindent Clipping may be called for by inserting the line

\beginlines
Û\special{ps: literal "doclip "}Û
\endlines

\noindent after the ÛstartTexFigÛ line. Also, there can be several Ûps: includeÛ lines calling for PostScript files, as in the previous scheme.

{\bf Method 3} --- The scheme of Anthony Li's {\DVITWOPS}, used by yet another dialect of Trevor Darrell's {\PSFIG} macro package:

\beginlines
Û\special{pstext="Û\angi{w} \angi{h} \angi{xll} \angi{yll} \angi{xur} \angi{yur} ÛstartTexFig"}Û
Û\special{psfile=Û\angi{eps-file}Û}Û
Û\special{pstext=endTexFig}Û
\endlines

\noindent Clipping to the specified bounding box may be requested 
by inserting the line:

\beginlines
Û\special{pstext="doclip"}Û
\endlines

\noindent after the ÛstartTexFigÛ line. As in the previous schemes, there may be several Ûpsfile=Û\angi{file-name} lines between ÛstartTexFigÛ and ÛendTexFigÛ.

If several figures share the same prolog file, then it may make sense
to read such a common prolog file once at the beginning. A user prolog file accessible to all included {\EPS} files may be inserted using:

\beginlines
Û\special{header=Û\angi{user-prolog-file}Û}Û
\endlines

{\bf Method 4} --- Another scheme supported by {\DVIPS}, generated by Tomas Rokicki's {\EPSF} macro package:

\beginlines
Û\special{PSfile=Û\angi{eps-file} Ûllx=Û\angi{xll} Ûlly=Û\angi{yll}
Û                urx=Û\angi{xur} Ûury=Û\angi{yur} Ûrwi=Û\angi{rwidth*10}Û}Û
\endlines

\noindent indicating that the file \angi{eps-file} is to be inserted with the 
{\it lower-left\/} corner of the bounding box of the inserted figure at {\TeX}'s current point (note that here the first two letters in the word ÛPSfileÛ are upper case).

Four of the arguments specify the bounding box of the figure. The last argument specifies the requested width of the figure (scaled by 10). The coordinate system in which the parameters are specified is the default PostScript coordinate system, with 72 units per inch (that is, {\TeX}'s `big points') with the origin at the lower left-hand corner of the page. The figure is scaled isotropically.

{\bf Method 5} --- The scheme of an older version of {\DVITWOPS}, due to Mark Senn {\it et al\/}, used by Gerald Roylance's macro package {\PSADOBE} and {\PSFIG}:

\beginlines
Û\special{psfile=Û\angi{eps-file}Û}Û
\endlines

\noindent indicating that the file \angi{eps-file} is to be inserted with the {\it origin\/} of the coordinate system of the inserted figure at {\TeX}'s current point. Additional arguments may be used to specify 
scaling and offsets, as well as clipping:

\beginlines
Û\special{psfile=Û\angi{eps-file} Ûhscale=Û\angi{x-scale} Ûvscale=Û\angi{y-scale}
Û        hoffset=Û\angi{x-offset} Ûvoffset=Û\angi{y-offset} Ûhsize=Û\angi{x-size}
Û        vsize=Û\angi{y-size}Û}Û
\endlines

\noindent All key-value pairs after the first are optional. Scales may be given as floating point quantities (and are {\it not\/} percentages). Offsets and clipping sizes are specified in `big points,' 72 to the inch. Different scaling in the horizontal and vertical directions may be specified. Note that in this scheme, the clipping rectangle, specified by ÛhsizeÛ and ÛvsizeÛ, is constrained to have its lower left-hand corner at the origin.

{\bf Method 6} --- The scheme for figure inclusion used by James Clark's {\DVITOPS}:

\beginlines
Û\special{dvitops: importÛ \angi{eps-file} \angi{width} \angi{height}Û}Û
\endlines

\noindent where \angi{width} and  \angi{height} are the desired width and height of the included illustration, specified in any of the units recognized by {\TeX}.

The illustration is scaled so that it will fit into the specified space. Scaling is the same in the horizontal and vertical directions --- the illustration is centered in the direction in which there is extra space. The {\it lower left-hand\/} corner of the bounding box is placed at {\TeX}'s current point. 

It is also possible to insert a prolog file using

\beginlines
Û\special{dvitops: prologÛ \angi{user-prolog-file}Û}Û
\endlines

\noindent The user's prolog file appears after {\DVIPSONE}'s own preamble, 
but before anything else, independent of where the corresponding Û\specialÛ occurred in the {\TeX} source file.

To switch the output to landscape mode for one page, start the page with:

\beginlines
Û\special{dvitops: landscape}Û
\endlines

\noindent In landscape mode, {\TeX}'s origin, normally 1 inch below and 1 inch to the right of the top left-hand corner of the page, is instead 1 inch {\it above\/} and 1 inch to the right of the {\it bottom\/} left-hand corner of the page.

{\bf Method 7} --- A scheme for figure inclusion supported by ArborText's 
{\DVILASER}{\trademark}:

\beginlines
Û\special{ps: epsfileÛ \angi{eps-file} \angi{scale-number}Û}Û
\endlines

\noindent indicating that the file \angi{eps-file} is to be inserted with the {\it lower left-hand\/} corner of the figure's bounding box placed at {\TeX}'s current point, scaled by \angi{scale-number}/1000. Scaling is optional; \angi{scale-number} should be an integer.

{\bf Method 8} --- The scheme used by Blue Sky Research's TeXtures{\trademark}:

\beginlines
Û\special{illustrationÛ \angi{eps-file} ÛscaledÛ \angi{scale-number}Û}Û
\endlines

\noindent indicating that the file \angi{eps-file} is to be inserted with the {\it lower left-hand\/} corner of the figure's bounding box placed at {\TeX}'s current point, scaled by \angi{scale-number}/1000. Scaling is optional; \angi{scale-number} should be an integer.

It is also possible to include PostScript program fragments in a file, using

\beginlines
Û\special{postscriptfileÛ \angi{postscript-file}Û}Û
\endlines

\noindent The difference between ÛillustrationÛ and ÛpostscriptfileÛ is that the former treats the file as an encapsulated PostScript file that is to be positioned in accordance with the bounding box specified in the file, while the latter treats the file as raw PostScript code to be inserted without any additional positioning.

{\bf Method 9} --- The scheme proposed by Nelson Beebe for his driver {\DVIALW},
where comma-separated key-value pairs appear, starting with the pair Ûlanguage "PS"Û (use a space between a key and the corresponding value, not `Û=Û').

For example,

\beginlines
Û\special{language "PS", include "Û\angi{eps-file}Û"}Û
\endlines

\noindent causes inclusion of the illustration in the file \angi{eps-file}. The included figure is positioned with the {\it upper left-hand\/} corner of the figure's bounding box placed at {\TeX}'s current point. If the figure is instead to be treated as an overlay (that is, using the default PostScript coordinate system) then use 

\beginlines
Û\special{language "PS", overlay "Û\angi{eps-file}Û"}Û
\endlines

{\bf Method 10} --- The command syntax for figure inclusion used by Andrew Trevorrow in Oz{\TeX} for the Macintosh, and in Psprint for Vax VMS.

\beginlines
Û\special{psfile=Û\angi{eps-file}Û}Û
\endlines

{\bf Method 11} --- The command syntax used by PC TeX. 

\beginlines
Û\special{eps: Û\angi{eps-file} Ûx=Û\angi{width} Ûy=Û\angi{height}Û}Û
\endlines

{\bf Method 12} --- The command syntax used by Scientific Word. This syntax requires using {\DVIPSONE}'s Û-*SÛ command line flag to prevent conflicts with other uses of Û\special{ps: ...}Û

\beginlines
Û\special{ps: Û\angi{eps-file}Û}Û
\endlines

{\DVIPSONE} also accommodates the command syntax of an older version of Andrew Trevorrow's OzTeX:

\beginlines
Û\special{Û\angi{eps-file}Û}Û
\endlines

\noindent This syntax only works if the command line flag Û-jÛ is used, because this form of Û\specialÛ does not include any special keyword or separator that could be used to distinguish it from other usage of Û\specialÛ, or from meaningless text. Instead the Û\specialÛ starts right off with the name of the file to be included. Activation of this command syntax is therefore somewhat risky.

\subsub{Adding a preview to an EPS file without one} Most Windows graphics
applications add a {\TIFF} or {\WMF} preview to {\EPS} files. Some Unix
graphics applications add an {\EPSI}-format preview to {\EPS} files.
{\DVIWindo} shows all three preview types. 

If you have an {\EPS} file without preview, you can add one using a commercial product such as Transverter Pro, available from TechPool Software, 1463 Warrensville Center Road, Cleveland, OH 44121-2676 USA. Phone (216) 291-1922 (voice) or (216) 382-1915 (fax).

Alternatively, you can use GhostScript %  2.6.1 
and GhostView % 0.7 
for Windows --- which are public domain, but harder to install and use. In
GhostView select `Edit' from the menu, then select `Add EPS Preview.' This
adds a preview in {\TIFF} format.

%% revise GhostView versions?  Or omit version numbers?

% For the PC/Windows version of GhostScript 2.6.1, you need the files
% Ûgs261win.zipÛ, Ûgs261ini.zipÛ and Ûgs261386.zipÛ. You may {\it not\/} want
% to get the Û.gsfÛ fonts that go with them (in files Ûgs22fnta.zipÛ,
% Ûgs22fntb.zipÛ, \dots Ûgs22fnte.zipÛ); use real Type~1 fonts instead.
% Rename  Ûfontmap.atmÛ to ÛfontmapÛ. The rendering of Type~1 fonts will not
% be as good as with {\ATM}, of course.

% For the GhostView 0.7 beta, you need the file Ûgsview07.zipÛ. One site is
% where it is available is Ûftp.cs.wisc.eduÛ, in directory Ûpub/ghostÛ.
% Another is Ûftp.cica.indiana.eduÛ, in Ûpub/pc/win3/utilÛ.

If you have trouble finding GhostScript and GhostView, 
then try Ûhttp://www.ghostscript.comÛ or
Ûhttp://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghostÛ,
or % try a search
try searching from Yahoo on WWW (i.e. Ûhttp://www.Yahoo.comÛ).
% Potential sites are Ûoak.oakland.eduÛ, Ûftp.cs.wisc.eduÛ,
% Ûftp.cica.indi-ana.eduÛ (and its mirrors), and Ûprep.ai.mit.eduÛ. 
% Alladin Site?

Avoid versions that need to be compiled or are written for other platforms.
Also avoid versions stored in compression schemes other than zip ---
including tar format, which must first be undone on Unix.

\subsub{Previewing inserted graphic files} Even if your {\EPSF} files all
have {\TIFF} previews, {\TeX} might still have problems with them. The
reason: {\TeX} figure-insertion macros, such as Trevor Darrell's {\psfigtex}
(available by anonymous FTP from Ûwhitechapel.media.mit.eduÛ) or Tom
Rokicki's {\epsftex}, do not like to read files with binary headers. 

% The following modification to the file-reading code in {\epsftex} attempts
% to surmount this problem. The only changes needed are the two lines
% following the comment lines starting with `\%-\%.' There are many dialects
% of {\psfigtex}, each tuned to a different {\DVI}-to-PostScript converter,
% but most share the same code for reading the bounding box.

A simple modification of these figure insertion macros gets around this
problem. 
Note that the graphics package in {\LaTeXe} already does the right thing.
The fix has also been incorporated in Ûepsfsafe.texÛ and Ûpsfigfx.styÛ in 
the ÛtexinputsÛ folder.

% The modification might not work in all situations, since the file-reading
% part of {\TeX} is somewhat implementation and version dependent. 
% However, the modification does work on several implementations we have
% tried, so it has a good chance of working for you.

One shortcoming of this modification, for which there is no easy workaround,
is that a binary file just may contain a very long stretch of bytes without a
`return' or `linefeed' character.  As a result in extreme cases an overflow
of the input buffer may occur, with an appropriately worded message (`Unable
to read entire line').  No clever tricks with Û\catcodeÛs can get around
this; however, the input buffer in {\yandy} TeX is very long and so should not
present a problem with most files, particularly if the PostScript section
precedes the {\TIFF} preview
(In addition, {\yandy} TeX has a special
trick to prevent it from bombing out when it meets such problem files).
% For such files one only has to survive 30 bytes of binary header information.

\subsub{Verbatim PostScript in DVI files} In certain rare cases you may be tempted to use verbatim PostScript code in your {\TeX} source files. The best advice we can give is: {\it don't\/}! If an effect can be achieved

\blist
\item directly in {\TeX} (using rules, or the {\LaTeX} line and circle fonts),

\item by insertion of an {\EPS} figure,

\item by insertion of a {\TIFF} image,

\item by use of emlines Û\specialÛs (see sample file Ûemlines.texÛ), or

\item by use of device-independent {\TPIC} Û\specialÛs
(see Ûtpictest.texÛ),

\endlist

\noindent then it is better {\it not\/} to use verbatim PostScript. For one
thing, a solution using {\TeX} alone is more portable. For another, you
cannot easily preview a file using inserted verbatim PostScript on a platform
that does not support Display PostScript --- and you cannot easily print such
a file on a non-PostScript printer. Furthermore, debugging inserted verbatim
PostScript can be very difficult. Most important, though, raw PostScript is
totally dependent on the environment used by a particular DVI-to-PostScript
driver. 

Some parts of the {\LaTeXe} package use verbatim PostScript to do their
magic.  Most of these work with {\DVIPSONE}, {\it provided\/} you select
ÛdvipsoneÛ as an option to the package.  Or, equivalently, have a file called
Ûgraphics.cfgÛ in the graphics package folder with the line
Û\ExecuteOption{dvipsone}Û.  

All that having being said, though, using verbatim PostScript in Û\specialÛs
for output through {\DVIPSONE} can produce some interesting effects --- such
as rotated text. Some experimentation may be required to achieve exactly the
effect you desire without disturbing {\TeX}'s positioning of text on the
page, or the current font selection.

There are several ways to use verbatim PostScript with {\DVIPSONE} (see
below). All have the potential of corrupting the PostScript output file.
Note, however, that some of the less protected methods for including verbatim
PostScript are enabled {\it only\/} if you use {\DVIPSONE}'s Û-jÛ command
line flag. Download {\ehandlerps} to the printer ahead of time to obtain
potentially useful debugging information.

In some of the schemes for including verbatim PostScript, the coordinates are
specified via the default PostScript coordinate system. In this standard
coordinate system, the origin is at the lower left corner, with $x$
increasing to the right and $y$ increasing upward, at 72 units per inch. In
some cases the inserted code is bracketed by Ûsave/restoreÛ or
Ûgsave/grestoreÛ pairs.

In addition, ÛPageHeightÛ and ÛPageWidthÛ are defined in PostScript points
(72 per inch). These quantities are accessible to verbatim PostScript and are
handy when one wants to flip the page horizontally or vertically, or to
rotate it. Also defined and accessible are the physical and logical page
numbers, ÛPhysicalPageÛ and ÛLogicalPageÛ. 
Finally, the dictionary called ÛdvidictÛ --- which is used by code in the
preamble and by code generated by {\DVIPSONE} --- is on top of the dictionary
stack.

Before we delve into the nitty gritty of raw Post\-Script inclusions,
just a reminder that it is in general safer to look for alternatives
using existing graphics packages, inserted {\EPS} graphics,
or standardized Û\specialÛ's like ÛemlinesÛ or {\TPIC}.

\subsub{Syntax for PostScript insertion $\backslash$specials} {\DVIPSONE}
accommodates a large number of schemes for including verbatim PostScript, in
order to provide partial support for methods used by other {\DVI} processors.
(We wish there were {\it some\/} standardization!) Here is the complete list: 

\blist
\item Û\special{verbatim="Û\angi{PS code}Û"}Û --- 
(standard {\PS} coordinate system; no Ûgsave/grestoreÛ)

\item Û\special{ps: Û\angi{PS code}Û}Û --- (naked {\PS} style,
% (standard {\PS} coordinate system;  98/Jun/5
no Ûgsave/grestoreÛ)

\item Û\special{postscript Û\angi{PS code}Û}Û --- Textures style 
(PS coordinates, but origin at current point; does Ûgsave/grestoreÛ)

\item Û\special{language "PS", literal "Û\angi{PS code}Û"}Û --- {\DVIALW}
style (standard {\PS} coordinates; full Ûsave/restoreÛ; 
treated like inserted figure) 

\item Û\special{"Û\angi{PS code}Û"}Û --- {\DVIPS} `literal graphics' 
(PS coordinates, but origin at current point; full Ûsave/restoreÛ) 

\item Û\special{dvitops: inline Û\angi{PS code}Û}Û --- {\DVITOPS} style; 
use Û-jÛ (no protection, except restores font)

\item Û\special{ps:: Û\angi{PS code}Û}Û --- % {\DVIPS} style; 
% use Û-jÛ  98/Jun/5
(naked {\PS} style, no Ûgsave/grestoreÛ) {\DVIPS} style; 

\item Û\special{pstext=Û\angi{PS code}Û}Û --- {\DVI}{\sc 2ps}-Li style; 
use Û-jÛ (no protection)

\item Û\special{ps: literal Û\angi{PS code}Û}Û --- {\DVI}{\sc 2ps}-SvB style;
use Û-jÛ (no protection)

\item Û\special{header=Û\angi{PS file}Û}Û --- user-supplied header file
(contribut\-ed to user-supplied prolog in ÛdvidictÛ)

\item Û\special{headertext=Û\angi{PS code}Û}Û --- user-supplied 
verbatim header (contributed to user-supplied prolog in ÛdvidictÛ)

\item Û\special{!Û\angi{PS code}Û}Û --- `literal macros'; 
% use Û-jÛ  
(contributed to a user-supplied prolog in ÛdvidictÛ)

\item Û\special{DSCheader=...}Û --- Adobe Document Structuring Convention 
header; use Û-jÛ (contributed to {\DSC} contents at start of file)
\endlist

\noindent Which method to use? As with the plethora of schemes for figure
inclusion using Û\specialÛ, the choice can be awkward. The following
suggestions may help:

\blist
\item If you are porting code designed for another driver, you may be able to
just use what is there, or use that method with some minor modifications. 

\item If you don't care what coordinate system you operate in, 
then use Ûps:Û. % then use Ûps::Û. 98/Jun/5 
This affords no protection and involves no overhead. Use your own
Ûgsave/grestoreÛ or Ûsave/restoreÛ, if appropriate. 

\item If you want to work in the standard PostScript coordinate system, use
Ûverbatim=...Û % Ûps:Û. 98/Jun/5
% This, too, affords no protection and involves very little overhead.
Use your own Ûgsave/grestoreÛ or Ûsave/restoreÛ, if appropriate. 
This, too, affords no protection and involves very little overhead.
\endlist

% \noindent (Use of Ûps:Û versus Ûps::Û may be just the opposite when using {\DVIPS}.)

\subsub{PostScript programming tips} Some additional useful tips for verbatim PostScript operations include:

\blist
\item In its PostScript output, {\DVIPSONE} always sets up the
parameters Û/PageHeightÛ, Û/PageWidthÛ,  
Û/LogicalPageÛ and Û/PhysicalPageÛ. 
% Û/LogicalÛ and Û/PhysicalÛ. % fixed 97/Nov/28
Any verbatim PostScript code you create can reference the values of these
parameters. 

\item You can define PostScript procedures that get called at the top of the page (ÛbphookÛ) and at the bottom of the page (ÛephookÛ). The default versions of these procedures do nothing. Both operate in the standard PostScript coordinate system and are inside the Ûsave/restoreÛ pair for the page. You can set up the procedures using a PostScript header/prolog file:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Û\special{header=Û\angi{user-prolog-file}Û}Û
}
\endlines

\noindent (or use Û-w=Û\angi{user-prolog-file} on the command line). Alternatively, use

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Û\special{headertext=Û\angi{verbatim-user-supplied-prolog}Û}Û
}
\endlines

\noindent Beginning-of-page hooks are useful for inserting backgrounds, crop marks and borders, or when changing the coordinate system. (Note that with some drivers other than {\DVIPSONE}, the equivalent of ÛbphookÛ is called Ûbop-hookÛ, and the equivalent of ÛephookÛ is called Ûeop-hookÛ.)

\item Do not leave anything on the stack (and do not remove any items you did not place there). {\DVIPSONE} produces PostScript code that relies on the stack, and that code will get confused if any additional items are found there after a Û\specialÛ.

\item If you need to preserve some information (say, the coordinate transformation matrix CTM, or the current location or the gray level), use variables to hold the values (as opposed to leaving things on the stack). Avoid short names that might conflict with names used by the {\DVIPSONE} preamble.

\item If necessary, use Ûsave/restoreÛ or Ûgsave/grestoreÛ --- {\it within\/} a particular Û\specialÛ --- to preserve the state and to restore it after the inserted PostScript code.

\item Avoid matching use of ÛsaveÛ or ÛgsaveÛ in one Û\specialÛ with ÛrestoreÛ or ÛgrestoreÛ in another Û\specialÛ. In most cases you will be preserving more of the state than you want, {\it and\/} undoing desired changes in state. Restore only the specific state variables that actually need to be restored (often just the current point). Alternatively, when restoring state, omit components that should not be restored.

\item To save the current point in one Û\specialÛ, use code like:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûcurrentpoint /savedy exch def /savedx exch defÛ
}
\endlines

\noindent You can later restore the current point (to get back to the same place on the page) using:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûsavedx savedy movetoÛ
}
\endlines

\item To save the CTM, use code like:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Û/savedCTM matrix currentmatrix defÛ
}
\endlines

\noindent You can restore it later (to get back the same coordinate transformation) using

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
ÛsavedCTM setmatrixÛ
}
\endlines

\item To save the current gray level in one Û\specialÛ, use code like:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Û/savedgray currentgray defÛ
}
\endlines

\noindent You can restore it later in another Û\specialÛ (perhaps because you changed the gray level while painting something directly in PostScript) using:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûsavedgray setgrayÛ
}
\endlines

\item To preserve the current font in one Û\specialÛ use code like:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Û/savedfont currentfont defÛ
}
\endlines

\noindent You can restore it later in another Û\specialÛ (perhaps because you inserted something using a different font) using:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûsavedfont setfontÛ
}
\endlines

\noindent (To preserve and restore state {\it within\/} a single Û\specialÛ, you can, of course, just use Ûsave/restoreÛ or Ûgsave/grestoreÛ, as appropriate.)

\item Do not confuse {\TeX}'s current point with the current point in PostScript. In particular, by moving the current point on the page using verbatim PostScript, you may get bizarre placement of text on the page (which may or may not be what you are after, of course\dots). Obviously, {\TeX} knows nothing of the changes you have made --- it assumes the current point is unchanged after a Û\specialÛ.

\item Always follow Û\special{...}Û with either additional {\TeX} control sequences or a `\%.' Otherwise {\TeX} will insert horizontal space where you do not expect it.

\item Always precede Û\special{...}Û with Û\leavevmodeÛ
when it is the first thing in a paragraph
(anything else that takes you out of vertical mode,
like Û\noindentÛ should work as well).
Otherwise spacing will be thrown off since the Û\specialÛ
then appears while you are still in vertical mode.
\endlist

\subsub{PostScript coding examples} The remainder of this section provides several detailed examples of verbatim PostScript code.
Note that some of the effects described here can be obtained
more easily by using the ÛgraphicsÛ or ÛcolorÛ packages in {\LaTeXe}.
One advantage of using these packages is that often the desired
effect will then {\it also\/} work in {\DVIWindo} 
(although sometimes only in Windows~NT).

\blist
\item {\bf Example 1a (rotated text block)}: A text block is to appear in the left margin rotated 90 degrees (so lines run down the page). Normal text is to resume below that.

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Û% This is the normal text before the rotated part:Û
ÛThe graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are so closely related that the graphÛ
Ûof $f$ can be used to visualize the graph of $f^{-1}$. If the graphÛ
Ûof $f$ is as shown in Figure 2(a),Û
Û% this sets up the rotated text (with narrower margins):Û
Û\setbox0\vbox{\hsize=13pc \raggedrightÛ
Û% You rotate this page counterclockwise through a right angle, thenÛ
Û% the graph of $f^{-1}$ appears on your left. TheÛ
Û% only trouble is that the numbering on the horizontal axis goes inÛ
Û% the wrong direction, so you must flip this picture over to get theÛ
Û% usual picture of $f^{-1}$, which appears on your right.Û
Û% The first \special preserves the current point and CTM;Û
Û% it then rotates the coordinate system by 90 degrees;Û
Û% the rotated text is then typeset;Û
Û% the second \special restores the CTM and the current point.Û
Û\special{ps:: currentpoint /savedy exch def /savedx exch defÛ
Û/savedmatrix matrix currentmatrix def 90 rotate}%Û
Û\box0Û
Û\special{ps:: savedmatrix setmatrix savedx savedy moveto}%Û
Û% We are now back where we were before the rotated text was insertedÛ
Û% Move down the page by amount equal to the width of the rotated textÛ
Û% (Otherwise the following text will appear next to the rotated part)Û
Û\vskip13pcÛ
Û% Now back to more text in normal orientation:Û
ÛThis procedure is awkward with books and impossible with blackboards,Û
Ûso it is fortunate that there is another way to construct the graphÛ
Ûof $f^{-1}$.Û
}
\endlines
\endlist

\noindent Note how the Û\specialÛs {\it only\/} preserve the CTM and the
current point. Using Ûgsave\grestoreÛ instead preserves the full graphical
state, including the current font, which can have undesirable results if
there are font switches. 

\blist
\item {\bf Example 1b (rotated text block)}: The same rotated text block can be obtained using:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Û\special{ps:: gsave 90 rotate}%Û
Û\box0Û
Û\special{ps:: currentfont grestore setfont}%Û
}
\endlines
\endlist

\noindent In this case, rather than explicitly saving {\it only\/} what needs
to be saved (CTM and current point), we save the full graphical state (using
ÛgsaveÛ), but then selectively avoid restoring parts of the state that should
stay the same (namely the current font). 

The reason one shouldn't restore the font is that {\TeX} is assuming that the
font after the second Û\specialÛ is exactly what it was before that
Û\specialÛ --- namely the font last used in the rotated text, rather than the
font that was selected just before the first Û\specialÛ (which is what
ÛgrestoreÛ would restore). 

A final comment on rotation: 
use the {\LaTeXe} ÛgraphicsÛ or ÛgraphicxÛ packages if possible.
If you do use some version of Ûrotate.styÛ instead, note that this style
file was designed for use with {\DVIPS}, which uses a left-handed 
coordinate system.  When using Ûrotate.styÛ with {\DVIPSONE} you may 
% make some small changes: 
% either (i) use Ûps::Û instead of Ûps:Û in Û\@vspecÛ, or (ii)
need to change the 90 to 270, and conversely change the 270 to 90. 
% Remember to use
In some cases you may also need to use
the {\DVIPSONE} Û-jÛ command line flag to enable raw PostScript. 

\blist
\item {\bf Example 2a (gray rules)}: A gray rule is to appear in some text:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
ÛThis (black) text is followed by a gray rule%Û
Û\special{ps:: /savedgray currentgray def .75 setgray}%Û
Û\hbox{\vrule height1pc depth0pt width 50pt}%Û
Û\special{ps:: savedgray setgray}%Û
ÛThis text is preceded by a gray rule (and is black again).Û
}
\endlines
\endlist

\noindent Note how the Û\specialÛs only preserve and restore the gray value. Because Ûgsave/grestoreÛ instead restores the full graphical state, including the current point, the text following would have been placed on top of the rule rather than to its right where it belongs.

\blist
\item {\bf Example 2b (gray rules)}: We can obtain the same gray rule between two pieces of text using:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
ÛThis (black) text is followed by a gray rule%Û
Û\special{ps:: gsave .75 setgray}%Û
Û\hbox{\vrule height1pc depth0pt width 50pt}%Û
Û\special{ps:: currentpoint grestore moveto}%Û
ÛThis text is preceded by a gray rule (and is black again).Û
}
\endlines
\endlist

\noindent As in example 1b, we use ÛgsaveÛ to save the full graphical state, but then selectively do not restore the part we don't want restored --- in this case the current point. We do not want to restore the current point because after typesetting the rule, {\TeX}'s current point is at the right end of the rule, not at the left, which is what ÛgrestoreÛ would restore (thus the following text would overprint the gray rule).

Again, note that it is best to use 
Û\special{color rgb: Û\angi{r} \angi{g} \angi{b}Û}Û instead of either of the
foregoing approaches.  
This is a device independent way of specifying color, and
both {\DVIPSONE} and {\DVIWindo} support this construct. % 96/Aug/26

\blist
\item {\bf Example 3 (2-color work)}: Here is one way to do simple 2-color work in {\DVIPSONE}, using only a PostScript Level 1 printer or imagesetter.
\endlist

\noindent Assign everything that is to appear in the spot color to some
special distinguishable gray level --- say, 0.5, if you can assume that
everything else is either 0 (black) or 1 (white). It is probably best to
define some macro for this since you might want to change gray values later.
You can then use the standard ÛcolorÛ Û\specialÛ's. Like

\beginlines
Û\def\blue#1{%Û
Û\special{color push gray 0.5}%Û
Û#1\special{color pop}}Û
ÛThis text is in black.Û
Û\blue{This text appears in blue.}Û
ÛThis text is again in black.Û
\endlines

\noindent gets you support in both {\DVIPSONE} and {\DVIWindo}.

This could also be done using raw Post\-Script: % Here is a simple example:

\beginlines
Û\def\blue#1{%Û
Û\special{ps:: /oldgray currentgray def 0.5 setgray}%Û
Û#1\special{ps:: oldgray setgray}}%Û
ÛThis text is in black.Û
Û\blue{This text appears in blue.}Û
ÛThis text is again in black.Û
\endlines

\noindent Run this through {\TeX}. 
Make up one PostScript file (say, Ûblack.psÛ):

\beginlines
Û{dup 0.4 gt 1 index 0.6 lt and {pop 1} if} settransferÛ
\endlines

% Û{dup 0.4 gt 1 index 0.6 lt and {pop 1} {pop 0} ifelse} settransferÛ

\noindent This maps 0.5 gray to 1 (white) and 
% {\it and\/} 1 
0 to 0 (black) and 1 to 1 (white).
Make up another PostScript file (say, Ûblue.psÛ):  

\beginlines
Û{dup 0.4 gt 1 index 0.6 lt and {pop 0} {pop 1} ifelse} settransferÛ
\endlines

\noindent This maps 0.5 to 0 (black) and 0 {\it and\/} 1 to 1 (white). 
The first file will be used for black, the second for blue. 

Now run the {\DVI} file through {\DVIPSONE} twice (use the Û-jÛ command line
flag so the program won't complain about the verbatim PostScript code). 
The first time use Û-w=blackÛ on the command line, the second time use
Û-w=blueÛ.  This pulls in the two PostScript files as prologs. The result
will be two PostScript output files, one for the black plate and one for the
blue.  (You'll have to rename or move the first output file to avoid
overwriting it the second time you call {\DVIPSONE}.) The same idea can be
extended to more than two colors; just pick a set of distinguishable gray
levels to label them. 

This method does not take into account the current transfer function, which
is OK in most cases. But for the politically correct way of doing something
more elaborate, see page 743 of the second edition of the {\tensl PostScript
Reference Manual}. 

Note that you can't rely on an exact {\it equality\/} test in the PostScript
code because of rounding problems and the discrete set of values (usually
256) in the lookup table used by the PostScript interpreter. In addition,
{\it everything\/} will be affected by this transfer-function modification.
So the method won't work well if your work contains inserted {\TIFF} images
with a continuous range of gray levels! 

The method {\it will\/} work with inserted {\EPS} figures, if those figures are created using the same conventions: 0.5 gray for blue and 0 gray for black. This may appear a little confusing at first, because instead of using colors directly, one uses one PostScript file per color --- and in each of these files the corresponding color is painted black.

Unfortunately, nothing analogous to ÛsettransferÛ (which works with ÛsetgrayÛ and ÛcurrentgrayÛ) is available to work with ÛsetrgbcolorÛ and ÛcurrentrgbcolorÛ (because it would need much too large a lookup table).

% Note that it is best to use Û\special{color rgb: Û\angi{r} \angi{g}
% \angi{b}Û}Û instead of the foregoing approach. This is definitely an instance
% where use of predefined Û\specialÛs may be better than raw PostScript. The
% construct   

% \beginlines
% Û\def\blue#1{%Û
% Û\special{color push rgb: 128 128 128}%Û
% Û#1\special{color pop}Û
% \endlines

% \noindent gets you support in both {\DVIPSONE} and {\DVIWindo}.

\blist
\item {\bf Example 4 (changing scale and position)}: You can change the scale and position on a page of output from {\DVIPSONE} using command line arguments Û-m=...Û, Û-x=...Û and Û-y=...Û. The same effects can be achieved by editing the PostScript file without rerunning {\DVIPSONE}, just by changing the values of Û/magÛ, Û/xoffsetÛ and Û/yoffsetÛ.
\endlist

\noindent To illustrate yet another way of using verbatim PostScript, consider how this can be done using a PostScript header file. Suppose the file we will construct is Ûcontrol.psÛ. Then {\it anywhere\/} in the {\TeX} source, say: 

\beginlines
Û\special{header=control}Û
\endlines

\noindent This inserts the PostScript text from Ûcontrol.psÛ ahead of any output from {\TeX} (and inside Ûdvidict begin ... endÛ).

Now create the header file with something like the following in it:

\beginlines
Û/bphook{Û
Û/mag 1200 defÛ
Û/xoffset 72 defÛ
Û/yoffset 72 defÛ
Û}defÛ
\endlines

\noindent This tells {\DVIPSONE} to start each page by redefining ÛmagnificationÛ to 1200 (instead of the default 1000), ÛxoffsetÛ to 72 pt (instead of 0), and ÛyoffsetÛ to 72 pt (instead of 0). 

\blist
\item {\bf Example 5 (suppressing } $\backslash${\ttb special}{\bf s used by other DVI processors)}: Each {\DVI} processor supports its own set of Û\specialÛs. Some of these are verbatim PostScript, and as such are passed by {\DVIPSONE} (since that program has no way to distinguish `intentional' use of verbatim PostScript and `bad' Û\specialÛs intended for a different driver). It is always best to edit the {\TeX} source to get rid of these Û\specialÛs. But sometimes that may not be possible.
\endlist

\noindent One way of dealing with this problem is to define dummy PostScript procedures. For example, if your driver uses Ûm1200Û to change the magnification and Ûcop3Û to change the number of copies, you may wish to define: 

\beginlines
Û/m1200{}defÛ
Û/cop3{}defÛ
\endlines

\noindent This code can then either be placed in a PostScript header file, read in using Û\special{header=...}Û, inserted using Û\special{headertext=...}Û, or appended to the {\dvipreamenc} file itself.

If your {\dvipreamenc} file is in binary form, first pass it through {\PFBtoPFA} to convert it to hexadecimal. Then rename the file ({\dvipreampfa}) back to {\dvipreamenc}. Finally, append your PostScript definitions, but bracket them in Ûdvidict beginÛ and ÛendÛ as follows:

\beginlines
Ûdvidict beginÛ
Û/m1200{}defÛ
Û/cop3{}defÛ
ÛendÛ
\endlines

\noindent What about calls that take arguments? Suppose your nonstandard Û\specialÛ is of the form Û\special{234 435 foo}Û. In that case, simply pop the arguments off the stack in the dummy procedure called `foo':

\beginlines
Û/foo{pop pop}defÛ
\endlines

\noindent Life is harder if the arguments {\it follow\/} the command, as in

\beginlines
Û\special{xy 234 435}Û
\endlines

\noindent In this case, you may be able to use ÛreadlineÛ to read and discard the rest of the line:

\beginlines
Û/xy{currentfile 256 string readline pop pop}defÛ
\endlines

\blist
\item {\bf Example 6 (modifying other drivers' } $\backslash${\ttb special}{\bf s)}: Sometimes verbatim PostScript for other {\DVI} drivers miraculously works in {\DVIPSONE}. Sometimes it almost works. One example is the following pair of Û\specialÛs for rotating a text block:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
Ûps:gsave currentpoint currentpoint translate 270 rotateÛ
Ûneg exch neg exch translateÛ
Ûps:currentpoint grestore movetoÛ
}
\endlines
\endlist

\noindent Although this code violates the rules, it almost works. The problem is that it is designed for a driver that uses a left-handed coordinate system. To make it work with {\DVIPSONE}, change the 270 to 90. Another approach is to change the Ûps:Û to Ûps::Û (and use the Û-jÛ command line flag).

\section{Operating System Issues}

The {\yandy} TeX System version 2.1 runs under Windows~95/98 and
Windows~NT. Some of its components ({\DVIPSONE}, {\yandy} TeX itself,
{\AFMtoTFM} etc.) can run %  separately
as `console applications' from a `command prompt'
(`Start{\down}Programs{\down}Command Prompt').
% in a {\DOS} window. 
This section describes some of the considerations involved in getting the
system's programs to function in these operating environments. 

One of the first things we recommend you do in terms of
adjusting your Windows preferences is to make sure
it shows you file extensions of all files.
Double click `My Computer,' then `View{\down}Folder Options,' 
and  select the `View' tab. 
Uncheck `Hide file extensions for known file types.'
Then double click on the `Hidden files' folder icon
(unless it is already open) and check `Show all files.'
(Details may depend on which version of Windows you are running).

While you are here, you may also want to check
`Smooth edges of screen fonts' in `Visual Settings' 
(not available in all versions of Windows).

\subsect{DOS Considerations in Windows 95/98}

The {\DOS}-related issues involving {\DVIPSONE} and {\yandy} TeX are not
specific to those programs. We describe them here since you may encounter
them in other contexts and may not be familiar with workarounds for potential
problems under {\DOS}. 

\subsub{Limitation on environment size} Sometimes it is convenient to control
the {\yandy} TeX System via {\DOS} environment variables rather than the
`environment variables' listed in the [Environment] section of
{\dviwindoini}. You can then use a batch file to change the values of the
variables for each project worked on. (You can't modify {\dviwindoini}'s
`environment variables' by this method. So remove from {\dviwindoini} the
variables you want to be able to change; the system will then look to the
{\DOS} environment for variables of the same name.) 

If you define many new {\DOS} environment variables for this purpose, you may run up against the default {\DOS} environment size. The default value of the environment varies, depending on the version of {\DOS}, but you can set the environment to any size by adding the line

\beginlines
ÛSHELL=C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND.COM C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\ /E:Û\angi{xxxx} Û/pÛ
\endlines

\noindent to your {\configsys} file, where \angi{xxxx} specifies the number
of bytes to be set aside for environment variables. 

Specify at least 1024, but avoid making the environment size much larger than
really needed, since the environment gets copied into the 64k data segment of
each 16-bit program that you run --- and some of these programs may not
have much space left in the data segment. % as is. 

\subsub{Limitation on the length of command lines} There is a 127-character
limit on any line typed at the command prompt. This can be a problem if you
are trying to pass many arguments to {\DVIPSONE}, for example.  

Specifically in the case of {\DVIPSONE}, you may want to set up commonly used command line parameters in the file {\dvipsonecmd}. Then you need only explicitly type on the command line those parameters that have not already been specified in this file. {\DVIPSONE} also can read indirect command files (response files). It interprets a file name preceded by `@' to be the name of a file containing command line flags and command line parameters.

The 127-character limitation also applies to {\autoexecbat}, so your {\PATH}
variable may not be as long as you would like it to be. There is no error
message --- anything longer than 127 characters is simply snipped off. As a
result, you may think that a given folder is on your {\PATH} when in fact it
is not. In {\autoexecbat}, use ÛPATH=...Û rather than ÛSET PATH=...Û to
squeeze out a few more characters. 
% You can also use Ûconfig.sysÛ where there is no line length limitations.

In Windows 95/98
you can determine the current values of your environment variables by typing
{\SET} at a command prompt. You may also use the {\SET} command in
{\configsys}, in addition to {\autoexecbat} --- and there is no limit on the
length of lines in {\configsys}. (In {\configsys}, though, you cannot use the
ÛPATH=...Û form; you must use ÛSET PATH=...Û.)

\subsect{Windows NT Considerations}

Problems and inconsistencies arising under Windows~NT relate primarily to the interpretation of the `\&' character and to NT's font-handling procedures.

\subsub{Placing `\&' in file and folder names} Windows~NT (as some other
operating systems like OS/2, Unix and some {\DOS} clones) uses `\&' on the
command line as a separator between two commands. This makes it awkward to
specify executables named Ûy&ytex.exeÛ, folders like
Ûc:\yandy\y&ytexÛ, environment variables named Ûy&ytexÛ and {\TeX} 
formats like Û&plainÛ. 

On the command line you {\it can\/} quote the \& by preceding it with
\char142\ % Û^Û
% (e.g., Ûc:\yandy\y^&ytex\y^&ytex.exe)Û, 
(e.g., {\tt Ûc:\yandy\yÛ\char142Û&ytex\yÛ\char142Û&ytex.exeÛ}), 
but this can get awkward
--- and it works only from the command line, not in a batch file.  
This is why % Therefore, in version 2.1 
we use the file and subfolder names Ûyandytex.exeÛ and Û\yandytexÛ 
rather than Ûy&ytexÛ.

\subsub{Allowing `+' instead of `\&' with the {\TeX} format} You tell {\TeX} what format file to use on the command line via the `\&.' For example,

\beginlines
Ûtex &latex ...Û
\endlines

\noindent loads up the {\LaTeX} 2e format (that is, the file {\latexfmt}). If no format is specified, then {\TeX} looks for the default format file, {\plainfmt}.

When you call {\TeX} from the command line in Windows~NT you need to quote
the \& by preceding it with \char142\ % Û^Û
% (e.g., Ûtex ^&lplainÛ). 
(e.g., {\tt Ûtex Û\char142Û&lplainÛ}). 
% Starting with version 1.2, 
To avoid the above mentioned problems,
{\yandy} TeX accepts + as an alternative to \& on the command line. 

\subsub{Font handling} 
% At the time of writing there is no Adobe Type Manager for Windows~NT. 
There now is an {\ATM} for Windows~NT. If you have it, use it,
since provides the best on-screen font rasterization.

However, under NT you can also install Type~1 fonts from the
Windows Control Panel and have them automatically converted to TrueType form
(provided the font vendor permits this). When you do so, you can also elect
to have the Type~1 fonts made available to the PostScript printer driver (so
the converted TrueType versions get used {\it only\/} for on-screen display
and the original Type~1 fonts get used for printing to PostScript printers).
We recommend checking all three check boxes in the dialog box for the
conversion process. 

The automatic conversion is somewhat better than that provided by some
commercially available font tools. However, for commercial grade, hand-hinted
Type~1 fonts --- such as fonts from {\yandy} --- there will be a noticeable
loss in display rendering quality, since the original hinting gets lost. For
less well-made fonts the converted version may render as well as the original
(the `auto hints' in the Type~1 version are not much better than the `auto
hints' in the TrueType version).

% following no longer true!

% Text fonts do not present any additional problems --- except that 
% you will be restricted to Windows {\ANSI} encoding since the {\ENCODING}
% environment variable has no effect. So use {\TFM} files set up for Windows
% {\ANSI}, not TeX 'n {\ANSI} (or hard-reencode the text fonts {\it before\/}
% conversion). 

For the most up-to-date information on font usage under Windows~NT, see the
file Ûntfonts.txtÛ in the Û\doc-miscÛ subfolder of your main {\yandy} program
folder.  And if you do have {\ATM} for NT, then use that.

\subsub{Long file names} In {\DOS}, long file names are automatically
truncated to $8+3$ characters. This does not happen in Windows~NT (even under
the older FAT file system). Consequently, when {\TeX} calls for files with
long names (such as {\texpool}, {\lcircle10tfm} and {\lcirclew10tfm}), those
files may not be found under the %  {\DOS}
shortened names. 

Therefore, in Windows~95/98, and on a Windows~NT installation,
% with a file system that supports long file names, 
you may have to rename Ûtex.pooÛ to
{\texpool}, Ûlcircle1.tfmÛ to {\lcircle10tfm} and Ûlcirclew.tfmÛ to
{\lcirclew10tfm}. The {\yandy} TeX System 2.1 installation program 
% attempts to do 
does this renaming automatically for you. 
% On a Windows~NT installation with a FAT file system (such as a dual 
% boot configuration),  
In some situations you may also wish to use the
Û-8Û command line flag, which forces {\yandy} TeX to truncate file names to
the {\DOS} $8+3$ convention. 

Avoid file names with spaces 
% (such as Ûc:\My Documents\TeX\foo.texÛ),
(such as Û"c:\My Documents\TeX\foo.tex"Û),
however, since {\TeX} parses its own command line and determines where the
file name ends by explicitly looking for a space character!

\subsub{Relating font file names to Windows Face Names} {\TeX} accesses
fonts through the name of the {\TFM} file, which normally is the same as the
font's other file names (but with different extensions, of course). For
example, the Adobe Type~1 outline font file for Times-Roman is
Ûtir_____.pfbÛ, the Windows metric file is Ûtir_____.pfmÛ, and the {\TeX}
metric file is Ûtir.tfmÛ. Similarly, the Wingdings TrueType outline font
file is Ûwingding.ttfÛ, the associated Û.fotÛ file is Ûwingding.fotÛ
(if present), and the corresponding {\TeX} metric file is Ûwingding.tfmÛ.

{\DVIWindo} has to find the relationship between font file name and Windows
Face Name so it can use the font in Windows.  It uses several different
methods depending on the operating system, the font type, and version
of {\ATM} installed (if any).  Here is the short version of the story:
For Type~1 fonts, it does this by looking for the file Ûatmreg.atmÛ 
(ATM~4), or in the [fonts] section of {\atmini} (ATM~3).
For TrueType fonts it looks in the registry (Windows~NT) or 
in the [fonts] section of {\winini} (Windows~95/98).
(Actually what is listed there is
the `Full Name', not the `Face Name', but that is another story\dots).
In Windows~NT, it looks instead for a [ttfonts] section, which is
set up by the ÛsetupttfÛ utility.

% ®MDRV¯actually that is a gross over-simplification :=)®MDNM¯

% Because there is currently no {\ATM} for Windows~NT, {\atmini} will not be
% updated when you install new fonts. In addition, Windows~NT uses the Registry
% instead of {\winini} to maintain its list of TrueType fonts, so {\winini}
% will not be updated either. 

% This is {\it not\/} a problem on a dual boot configuration, where Windows~NT
% is just using fonts that have already been installed in Windows 3.1. There,
% the appropriate entries will already exist in {\winini}. When new fonts are
% installed that are only available in Windows~NT, though, or on a single boot
% Windows~NT configuration, an extra step may be required.

Under Windows~NT {\DVIWindo} attempts to read installed font information
from the Registry.  This is somewehat unreliable since the `font name'
in the registry is a made-up name (not the Windows Face Name, nor
the {\PS} FontName, nor the fonts FullName!).

If {\DVIWindo} complains that it can't find
TrueType fonts, you can create the appropriate {\winini} entries
automatically by using {\yandy}'s {\SETUPTTF} utility. You can invoke this
utility with Û-sÛ on the command line to get (i) a list of all TrueType fonts
recorded in the [fonts] section of {\winini}, and (ii) a list of all TrueType
fonts Ûc:\windows\system\*.fotÛ 
(output can be redirected to a file if desired). 

Invoke {\SETUPTTF} with no arguments (it defaults to Û-vfnmÛ
in this case) to actually update the Û[ttfonts]Û section of {\winini}.

If your {\winini} file is not in the standard place (Ûc:\winntÛ), 
specify the Windows folder using the command line argument Û-W=...Û. 
If your Û.ttfÛ % Û.fotÛ
files are not in the standard place (Ûc:\winnt\fontsÛ), specify the system
folder using the command line argument -ÛS=...Û.

Alternatively, you can explicitly list the Û.ttfÛ or Û.fotÛ 
files to be considered on the command line --- and note that wildcards are
accepted:

\beginlines
Ûsetupttf -m c:\winnt\*.fotÛ
\endlines

\noindent If your {\winini} file is not in the standard place 
(Ûc:\windowsÛ or Ûc:\winntÛ),
you may wish to create a dummy file in that folder for {\SETUPTTF} to update. 

\subsect{Windows 95/98 Considerations}

The {\yandy} TeX System requires few adjustments and/or workarounds
under Windows~95/98. For the most up-to-date information, consult file
Ûwin95.txtÛ in the Û\doc-miscÛ subfolder of your main {\yandy} program
folder. 

If you print to a {\PCL} printer, you {\it will\/} need {\ATM} version 3.02
or later;
version 3.01 has problems using `soft fonts' under Windows~95/98 in that
printing mode (when using {\PCL} printers you may also have to deal with
bugs in the Windows 95 {\PCL} printer drivers, see Ûwin95.txtÛ).
%
For on-screen display and printing to {\PS} % Post\-Script
devices, Adobe Type~1 fonts work just fine under Windows~95/98 --- as 
long as you have installed Adobe Type Manager version 3.01 or later.

\subsub{Special DOS issues} The {\DOS} under Windows~95 (98) is version 
7.0 (7.1).
If you installed on top of an older version of {\DOS}, and your {\PATH} is
not set up correctly, you may get `Incorrect {\DOS} Version' errors in
various situations.

Your {\PATH} should list Û\windows\commandÛ (the new {\DOS} folder) first, before Û\dosÛ (the old {\DOS} folder); otherwise the {\XCOPY} and {\FIND} commands will not work. In addition, {\PATH} should list both the new {\DOS} folder and the old {\DOS} folder, otherwise other {\DOS} commands such as {\REPLACE} will not work (since they are not defined in the new folder). A typical {\PATH} definition in {\autoexecbat} might thus be:

\beginlines
ÛPATH c:\windows;c:\windows\command;c:\dos;c:\utility;...Û
\endlines
\subsub{Font considerations} Make sure that {\ATM} knows about the Type~1
fonts you have (check the {\ATM} Control Panel). Also check font installation
using `Font{\down}Show Fonts' in {\DVIWindo}; you need to reinstall your fonts
if they do not show up here.

\section{Appendix}

\subsect{Frequently Asked Questions}

{\Q Q1:} The glyph `AE' mysteriously shows up in my printed output when I Û\inputÛ a particular file.

{\A} You probably have a Ctrl+Z (character code 26) in the file. In {\DOS},
Ctrl+Z indicates the end of the file, and so {\yandy} TeX ignores a Ctrl+Z
that is the very last byte in a file.  
% ®MDRV¯(unless you use the command line flag Û-zÛ). 96/Aug/26®MDNM¯
But {\it inside\/} a file, {\yandy} TeX allows {\it all\/} character codes including `control' characters. You probably have some invisible white space after the Ctrl+Z and before the true end of file.

% {\Q Q2:} Accents appear {\it before\/} the letter to be accented, rather than over it. What's wrong?

% {\A} You are probably using `old style' syntax of the form

% \beginlines
% Û\"{a}, \'{e}, \c{c}, ...Û
% \endlines

% \noindent to specify accented characters. This prevents {\TeX} from linking to the ready-made accented characters in the font. Use instead:

% \beginlines
% Û\"a, \'e, \c c, ....Û
% \endlines

% \noindent If this still does not work as desired, then your {\TFM} files may lack the appropriate pseudo ligatures (or you are perhaps using fonts that do not have ready-made accented characters). Make new {\TFM} files. If you do this by executing {\AFMtoTFM} directly, remember to use the command line flags ÛaÛ, ÛdÛ and ÛjÛ:

% ®MDRV¯hmm, now texnansi.tex and ansiacce.tex no longer depend on pseudo ligs®MDNM¯

% \beginlines
% Ûafmtotfm -vadjx -c=texnansi tir_____.afmÛ
% \endlines

% \noindent (This is automatic if you instead execute `WriteTFM\dots' from {\DVIWindo}.)
 
% Another alternative is to {\it not\/} use the ready-made accented characters in the fonts. If you place Û\input texnansiÛ in your source file, {\it un\/}comment the Û\buildcompositesÛ statement in it.
 
{\Q Q2:} How do I use BibTeX, MakeIndx or DVICOPY?

{\A} These utilities are all in the ÛutilÛ sub-folder of your ÛyandyÛ folder.
You may find it most convenient to use these from the command prompt
(`Start{\down}Programs{\down}Command Prompt').
Gather all the necessary files into a common folder and make
that the current folder.
You can instead set {\DOS} environment variables
(either ÛTEXINPUTSÛ and ÛTEXBIBÛ, or
ÛBIBINPUTSÛ and ÛBSTINPUTSÛ)
to tell these utilities where the inputs are.
%% env variables for BibTeX ???
Other versions of these utilites may also be found on the CD
in the Ûwin32Û sub-folder of the ÛCTANÛ folder.

{\Q Q3:} I keep getting complaints about encoding errors in CM fonts and I don't know what's causing them.

{\A} The Computer Modern text fonts are {\it not\/} ordinary text fonts, since they have a most peculiar character layout that matches no other known encoding, contain very many fewer than the standard 228 glyphs expected in a normal text font, and are designed to be used with fixed hardwired encoding. They must therefore be marked `symbol/math/pi/decorative', {\it not\/} `text.'

Despite this fact, some TrueType versions of the CM fonts are marked as
`text' fonts, and so {\DVIWindo} tries to reencode them --- which doesn't
work since TrueType fonts cannot be reencoded in Windows~95/98.

You {\it must\/} deinstall all TrueType versions of the CM fonts, {\it and\/}
physically remove all the font files from your hard drive, before installing
the CM fonts that {\yandy} supplies (As an added benefit you will get 
noticably better on-screen rendering of the CM fonts).
After deleting the TrueType CM fonts, remove the stain left on your hard-drive 
with a strong detergent (just kidding!).

{\Q Q4:} I use Computer Modern fonts. The character layout of the {\CM} text fonts does not appear to be affected by on-the-fly encoding.

{\A} The {\CM} text fonts are not standard text fonts as recognized by
Windows; to work in Windows as required by {\TeX}, they are marked
symbol/math/pi/decorative rather than `{\ANSI} text.'  
% ®MDRV¯(The {\CM} text fonts use their own peculiar character layout and do not have anywhere near the `standard' complement of 228 glyphs for text fonts).®MDNM¯
As a result, {\CM} text fonts are {\it not\/} affected by the automatic
reencoding of standard text fonts specified by the {\ENCODING} environment
variable. % (in the [Environment] section of {\dviwindoini}). 

It is possible to reencode the {\CM} fonts to make the 58 accented characters
accessible (see section~6.9). Before you do this, though, consider that the
modified fonts then will not act the way {\TeX} expects them to, since
special characters will be in different places. To accommodate this change,
you would need to read in a suitable {\TeX} macro header file (such as
Ûtexnansi.texÛ).

In addition, the {\CM} text fonts do not have a full complement of glyphs.
They contain only $128-16+58$ of the `standard' 228 glyphs found in regular
text fonts. They even lack some {\ASCII} characters like `braceleft' and
`braceright,' % as well as 
`less,' `greater,' `underscore,' `backslash,' `bar,'
`quotesingle,' `quotedbl,' `asciitilde,' `asciicircumflex,' etc.
If you like the `Computer Modern' look, but want ordinary text fonts
that can be reencoded like other text fonts, consider the new
`European Modern' (EM) fonts.

{\Q Q5:} If I try to launch `{\DVIWindo} Help,' there are complaints about
missing fonts like `Times New Roman,' `Arial,' and `Courier New.'

{\A} The Help file uses standard Windows TrueType fonts. Make sure you have
TrueType enabled and that these fonts are properly installed. 
%
Check that these fonts show up in the Windows Character Map utility. If the
fonts do not show up in Character Map, reinstall them from your Windows 
CD or diskettes. Make sure you have the corresponding Û.ttfÛ and Û.fotÛ files
actually on your hard disk (they are placed there by the Windows
installation).
Check that the entries in the [fonts]
section of {\winini} refer to the correct folder.

{\Q Q6:} I am using `TeX 'n {\ANSI}' encoding for text fonts. Accented
characters, special characters like `germandbls,' and most accents work fine,
but `dotaccent' (sometimes used for derivatives) does not. 

{\A} While most special characters and accents in `TeX 'n {\ANSI}' are in the
same place as the `TeX Text' encoding used in most Computer Modern text
fonts, a few are not. This is because TeX Text encoding does {\it not\/}
match {\ASCII} encoding. To use TeX 'n {\ANSI} effectively you should add
Û\input texnansiÛ to your plain {\TeX} of {\LaTeX} 2.09 source file. 
In {\LaTeXe} use Û\usepackage[LY1]{fontenc}Û instead.
That way you gain access to
`dotaccent,' `hungarumlaut' and `ogonek' --- and also set up proper `lower
case codes' for the accented characters.  

{\Q Q7:} I switched to `TeX 'n {\ANSI}' (or some other) encoding and now
ligatures (or special characters, or accented characters) don't show up
correctly in some text font (i.e., they are blank, missing or replaced with a
`bullet,' or else replaced with the wrong glyph).

{\A} These are typical encoding problems. 
% Make sure you have at least {\ATM} 2.6 --- check in the {\ATM} Control Panel.
Make sure {\ATM} is `On.' Also make sure you have the encoding vector
Ûtexnansi.vecÛ (or whatever you are using) where {\DVIWindo}, {\AFMtoTFM} and
{\DVIPSONE} can find it. Typically the environment variable {\VECPATH} points
to the folder containing vectors. Then check that the text font is showing up
properly in {\DVIWindo}; use `Show Font' from the `Font' menu. In the case of
TeX 'n {\ANSI}, the first line should show 
`fraction,' `dotaccent,' `hungarumlaut,' `ogonek,' 
and the f-ligatures (these lines are blank for Windows
{\ANSI}). The last six lines should show most of the 58 standard accented
characters.

Make sure you are telling {\TeX} about the position of special characters in
the encoding you have selected. Use the appropriate {\TeX} header file in
your plain {\TeX} or {\LaTeX}~2.09 source file: Û\input texnansiÛ for TeX 'n
{\ANSI} encoding or Û\input ansiacceÛ for Windows {\ANSI} encoding.
In {\LaTeXe} use Û\usepackage[LY1]{fontenc}Û or
Û\usepackage[ansinew]{texnansi}Û respectively.

{\Q Q8:} How can I check whether the actual font files are set up properly for
on-the-fly font encoding? 

{\A} Use the {\DECODE} utility as described in section 2.5.7.

{\Q Q9:} After running the {\DECODE} utility I have ascertained that my
{\PFB}, {\PFM} or {\TFM} files are {\it not\/} set up for the appropriate
encoding. What to do?

{\A} For {\it text\/} fonts only (math fonts have hardwired encoding): If the
{\PFB} and/or {\PFM} files are incorrect, then simply reinstall them from the
original font diskettes, using the {\ATM} Control Panel. This will give you
the original files, which are set up as required. 
% If you do not have the original {\PFB} and {\PFM} files, you must `revert'
% the current versions, as described in section 2.4.2. 

{\Q Q10:} My {\TeX} formats include {\TeX} macro header files that I use
frequently. Now I can't get on-the-fly reencoding to work. What gives?

{\A} A {\TeX} format file includes `frozen-in' {\TFM} files for fonts that
the format calls for. Changes you make to the {\TFM} files in the {\TEXFONTS}
folder {\it after\/} creating the format have no effect. You can check on
where {\yandy} {\TeX} is getting font metric information from by using the
Û-ZÛ command line flag --- all {\TFM} files will then be listed in the log.

% {\Q Q11:} I am running the {\yandy} TeX System under Windows~NT and the text
% fonts always show up with Windows {\ANSI} encoding, no matter how I set the
% {\ENCODING} environment variable.

% {\A} At the moment there is no {\ATM} for Windows~NT. The Font Installer in
% NT's Control Panel provides for automatic conversion of Type~1 fonts to
% TrueType format. However, there is no way to reencode TrueType fonts on the
% fly, so all text fonts appear with Windows {\ANSI} encoding. Use Û\input
% ansiacceÛ in your source file. And make sure the {\TFM} files are set up for
% Windows {\ANSI}.

% If you are using fonts that were automatically converted from Type~1 to
% TrueType form, another option is to reencode the Type~1 fonts {\it before\/}
% conversion, using {\ENCODE}, as explained in section 2.5.2.

{\Q Q11:} When there are no errors, the window in which {\TeX} is
running disappears as soon as it is done.  How can I pause it
so that I can read what is in that window?

{\A} All the information that appears in that windows (and more)
is in the {\LOG} file.  The {\LOG} file has the same name as the
{\TeX} source file, but extension Û.logÛ.  It appears in the same
place as the corresponding Û.dviÛ file.  Hence if you have
a common ÛWorkingDirectoryÛ the {\LOG} file will appear there.
If you don't, the {\LOG} file will be in the same folder as 
the {\TeX} source file.

You can also cause {\TeX}, {\DVIPSONE} and {\AFMtoTFM} to
pause before and after they run by checking `Fonts{\down}Pause WinExe'.
In each case you can then proceed by hitting any key while the
paused window has the focus.


% {\Q Q12:} I am running the {\yandy} TeX System under Windows~NT 3.51, and
% {\DVIWindo} complains that it cannot find any of the fonts I use, even though
% I installed them using the Control Panel Font Installer (which automatically
% converted them from Type~1 to TrueType format).

%  {\A} The font installer in Windows~NT 3.51 creates Û.fotÛ and Û.ttfÛ files
% with the correct font names embedded, but then `installs' the fonts in the
% Registry with the wrong names. This problem has been fixed in Windows~NT 4.0.
% Under 3.51, first try using the {\SETUPTTF} utility. If that doesn't solve
% the problem:

% \blist
% \item Determine what Û.fotÛ and Û.ttfÛ files correspond to the fonts you
% installed. One way to do this is to look in the Registry with the Registry
% Editor (Ûc:\windows\system32\regedt32.exeÛ), under  

% \beginlines
% {\parindent=1pc
% ÛHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows~NT\CurrentVersion\FontsÛ
% }
% \endlines

% \noindent You can also use {\yandy}'s {\SETUPTTF} utility to list Û.ttfÛ
% or Û.fotÛ files and the names recorded in them; e.g., Ûsetupttf -ZÛ. If you use
% nonstandard directories, execute Û-?Û on the command line to learn how to
% tell {\SETUPTTF} where your font files are.

% \item  Copy all of the installed font files (typically in
% Ûc:\windows\systemÛ) to a temporary folder. Delete the original files. Then
% `Remove' all of the fonts, using `Fonts' in the Control Panel. Finally,
% reinstall the fonts from the temporary folder.   
% \endlist

{\Q Q12} When I call {\TeX} from {\DVIWindo} a window flashes briefly
on screen and then disappears.  No {\DVI} file appears.
How can I discover what the problem is?

{\A} Normally when there is an error, {\TeX} will pause rather than
exit after completing its task.  But if due to some error {\TeX}
is never actually called, it has no chance to stop the window
from disappearing again.  Typically such problems are somehow
related to the way {\TeX} --- or {\DVIPSONE} or {\AFMtoTFM} ---
is called from {\DVIWindo}.

You can cause {\DVIWindo} to show you how it tries to call {\TeX},
{\DVIPSONE} and {\AFMtoTFM} by checking `Fonts{\down}Show WinExe.'
Looking at the command line used will usually dispell the mystery.
The problem may be related to settings of environment variables
or to the parameters being passed.

{\Q Q13:} My text fonts show up correctly on screen --- complete with
ligatures and special characters --- but the ligatures and/or special
characters do not print correctly on a PostScript printer. What could the
problem be? 

{\A} Mismatch between on-screen view and printing to a PostScript printer can
result from a mismatch between what the {\PFB} and the {\PFM} files say about
encoding. For a text font, the {\PFB} file should contain the line Û/Encoding
StandardEncoding defÛ. The {\PFM} file should be set up for Windows {\ANSI}
encoding. Use the {\DECODE} utility to verify this. 

In addition, if you use on-the-fly reencoding make sure you have set the
encoding as desired. Check `Fonts{\down}Encoding', or equivalently the 
{\ENCODING} variable in the [Environment] section of {\dviwindoini}
This should be the name of the desired encoding vector.
% (and {\TEXANSI} should {\it not\/} be set to 1); 
% Conversely, if you use Windows {\ANSI} encoding,
% make sure that {\ENCODING} is set to `ansinew.'
% and that {\TEXANSI} is set to 1. 

{\Q Q14:} My text fonts print correctly on a PostScript printer, but are not
rendered correctly on screen --- the ligatures and/or special characters do
not show correctly. What could the problem be? 

{\A} 
% Check that you have {\ATM} version 2.6 or later. 
Verify that {\ATM} is `On.' Check that the encoding vector you specified is
somewhere where {\DVIWindo} can find it. Typically the {\DVIWindo}
environment variable {\VECPATH} points to a folder with encoding vectors.
Also check in {\dviwindoini} for ÛLastError=...Û, which may provide
additional information. See also {\bf Q7}. % Q7 ???

{\Q Q15:} With some fonts, `WriteTFM\dots' does not appear to produce the
correct result. Also, on-screen display does not match the vector specified
by the {\ENCODING} environment variable. 

{\A} This can happen if the flags in the {\PFM} file are not set correctly.
Use {\DECODE} on the {\PFM} file to check that it is set up for Windows
{\ANSI}. In addition, {\ATM}'s font cache can get corrupted if you make many
changes or have many fonts installed. In this case, delete the {\atmfontsqlc}
file and reboot your system (ATM~3).

% {\Q Q16:} I am switching to the new color Û\specialÛs from the old ones. 
% But I seem to be missing a file called Ûcolor.epsÛ. 

% {\A} Unfortunately, Û\special{color ...}Û does not use a distinguishing
% delimiter after the token ÛcolorÛ (not our idea!), so it is interpreted as
% possibly the name of an {\EPS} file to be inserted. (By the way, just
% specifying the name of an {\EPS} file in a Û\specialÛ --- without any key
% word or other mark --- is another unusually bad idea, but one supported by
% some other drivers, which is where this particular problem originates.) 

{\Q Q16:}
When I try to transfer typeset material on the clipboard from
{\DVIWindo} to Word~97
nothing appears in Word~97.

{\A}  If you look on the clipboard you will see that material copied from
{\DVIWindo} does appear there.  To look at the clipboard use
`Start{\down}Programs{\down}Accessories{\down}Clipboard Viewer'
(If you don't have it installed, use 
`Settings{\down}Control Panel{\down}Add/Remove Programs').

In any case, there is a bug in several new MicroSoft `97' applications
that prevents them from recognizing Windows MetaFiles in `isotropic' mode
(which is supposed to prevent the importing application from distorting
the material). The work around is to add:

ÛISOTROPIC=0Û

\noindent to the Û[Window]Û section of Ûdviwindo.iniÛ

{\Q Q17:} Every time I launch {\TeX} from {\DVIWindo} I get this horrible
`This application has violated system integrity' error message
in Windows~95.

{\A} Try launching a {\DOS} box by double clicking with the mouse --- you
will most likely get the same error message. Try launching {\TeX} using a hot
key instead of using the mouse to select from {\DVIWindo}'s `TeX' menu ---
you most likely will {\it not\/} get the message. If this is the case, you
have a conflict between Windows mouse service and {\DOS} mouse service. You
may have to comment out the line in {\autoexecbat} that launches your {\DOS}
mouse program.

{\Q Q18:} Whenever I print, the `Use {\DVIPSONE}' box is checked, even when I
want to print to a non-PostScript device like my fax board. I can always
`uncheck' the box when I `print' to a non-PS printer, but this is
 inconvenient.   

{\A} You can control whether or not the `Use {\DVIPSONE}' box is initially
checked for a given printer via an entry in {\dviwindoini}. Add a line
listing the ports on which you have PostScript devices.  This semicolon
separated list goes in the [Window] section of {\dviwindoini}. For example:   

\beginlines
ÛUseDVIPSONE=LPT1:;COM2:;FILE:Û
\endlines

\noindent If you {\it never\/} want the `Use {\DVIPSONE}' check box checked, insert ÛUseDVIPSONE=BOGUS:Û instead.

{\Q Q19:} Timothy Van Zandt's PSTricks doesn't seem to work properly with {\DVIPSONE}.

{\A} PSTricks uses raw PostScript to do all the wonderful things it does.
Each printer driver creates a different PostScript environment, so PSTricks
needs to be told what {\DVIPSONE} requires. Look in the Û\psÛ subfolder of
your main {\yandy} program folder for the file Ûpstricks.proÛ and in the
Û\texinputÛ subfolder for Ûpstricks.conÛ (a {\TeX} header file), both of
which are specially modified to work with {\DVIPSONE}.

{\Q Q20:} {\DVIWindo} doesn't seem to recognize a new TrueType font I
installed. It shows up in `Fonts{\down}Show Fonts,' but when I use it in
{\TeX}, {\DVIWindo} complains it can't find it.

{\A} Check the name under which the font is installed, using the Registry
database editor. % as described in the answer to {\bf Q12}. % Q12 ???
It most probably does not match the `Full Name' in the font's 
Û.ttfÛ or Û.fotÛ file.
Use the {\SETUPTTF} utility with Û-ZÛ on the command line to check on the
names in the Û.fotÛ file. If the font is mistakenly installed under the
PostScript FontName instead of the PostScript FullName, reinstall it.
%  as described in the answer to {\bf Q12}.  % Q12 ???

{\Q Q21:} How can I tell {\LaTeX} to use the VI editor when {\LaTeX}
encounters a syntax error and I want to edit the line that is causing the
error?  

{\A} Add this to the [Environment] section of {\dviwindoini}:

\beginlines
ÛTEXEDIT=vi +%d %sÛ
\endlines

\noindent When (La){\TeX} encounters an error, instead of using `x' to
terminate execution, use `e' to edit the file. 

{\Q Q22:} How can I add a link to my VI editor in the `TeX' menu?

A: You can edit the `TeX' menu directly from {\DVIWindo} (refer to the main
manual). Alternatively, in the [Applications] section of {\dviwindoini} you
may want to add   

\beginlines
ÛVI|F9=c:\tools\cmds\vi.exe @.texÛ
\endlines

\noindent so you will be able to press F9 whenever you want to edit the file
that you are viewing under {\DVIWindo}. (Substitute your setup's actual path
to Ûvi.exeÛ.)  Check that F9 isn't already used in another TeX menu entry.

{\Q Q23:} When I insert a PostScript level 2 {\EPS} file, pages of junk come
out of the printer. 

{\A} {\DVIPSONE} parses level 2 code properly, including binary data. However, 

\blist
\item An {\EPS} figure made for a level 2 printer will most likely not print
on a level 1 printer. Make sure your printer is level 2. 

\item An {\EPS} file containing binary data may not print over a serial or
parallel link even if the printer is a level 2 printer. Use an AppleTalk or
EtherNet connection --- both of which have separate job control channels ---
to avoid interpreting control characters in binary data as job control
commands.

\item When transferring an {\EPS} file containing binary data from a
Macintosh to an IBM PC, make sure that it is {\it not\/} treated as a text
file. Otherwise translation of line-termination characters will corrupt the
file's binary part.

% ®MDRV¯\item If your {\EPS} file contains binary data, suppress {\DVIPSONE}'s own line-termination translation using the command line flag Û-RÛ.®MDNM¯
% ®MDRV¯96/Aug/26 (this is going to be the default now for safety)®MDNM¯
\endlist

\noindent In general, you should avoid binary data in {\EPS} files (except
for the {\TIFF} header). If possible, use {\TIFF} files for images instead of
{\EPS} files.  

{\Q Q24:} I get errors in ÛmakefontÛ and ÛscalefontÛ on my imagesetter with
PostScript files produced by {\DVIPSONE}. 

{\A} You have an `Emerald'-based RIP (probably an Agfa Viper or Lino 50).
These have an error in the matrix multiplication arithmetic for the
ÛmakefontÛ and ÛscalefontÛ operators. Use Û-*A=10000Û on the command line
with {\DVIPSONE} for a workaround. 

{\Q Q25:} I print on A4 paper and rules (like division lines) near the top of
the page come out too low on the page.

{\A} You probably have a QMS 1660-2 or related printer. These printers have
an arithmetic overflow error which appears when using large coordinates. Use
Û-*A=10000Û on the command line with {\DVIPSONE} for a workaround.  

{\Q Q26:} LucidaBright Roman (or some other upright font) shows italic in
{\DVIWindo}. 

{\A} Select the font in question in `Fonts{\down}Show Font.' Check all four
styles. If `{\sc *synthetic*}' shows up in the title bar, there is a problem
with the font files for that style. For example, the {\PFM} file may be
missing or corrupted. Reinstall the fonts. Alternatively, in rare cases, the
{\ATM} Quick Load Cache may get corrupted. In that case, delete the file
{\atmfontsqlc} (typically in Ûc:\psfontsÛ) and reboot your system. 

{\Q Q27:} When I print to my QMS printer, output from {\DVIPSONE} is shown as
{\ASCII} PostScript code instead of being interpreted as PostScript. But if I
`print to file' from {\DVIPSONE} and then copy that file to Ûlpt1:Û
everything works fine. What gives?

{\A} Different printers use different methods to decide whether or not the
input data they receive is PostScript code. Some QMS printers require more
than just a line starting Û%!PS-Adobe-3.0\...Û. 
{\DVIPSONE} leaves out most header comment lines when sending output directly
to a printer. You can force it to include all header comment lines by using
Û-YÛ on the command line.
 
% ®MDRV¯The above may now be obsolete ?®MDNM¯

{\Q Q28:} {\DVIPSONE} is having problems printing to my Hewlett-Packard
PostScript printer. What might the matter be? 

{\A} {\DVIPSONE} cannot print if you have an application tying up the printer
port.  If you have trouble printing to an HP PostScript printer using
DVIPSONE, check your {\winini} file for Ûrun=...Û or Ûload=...Û entries in
the Û[Window]Û section, which may be loading a printer specific `print monitor'
or spooler.  Remove any such entries.   

See also Ûwin95.txtÛ in Ûdoc-miscÛ.

{\Q Q29:} I'm having trouble printing to a networked PostScript printer. What gives?

{\A} First check whether you can print a PostScript file by copying it to the
port to which the printer is assigned. For example: 

\beginlines
ÛCOPY c:\yandy\dvipsone\debug\printst1.ps LPT3:Û
\endlines

\noindent You may need to talk to your network guru if this does not work.
Also please refer to Ûnetprint.txtÛ in your Ûdoc-miscÛ sub-folder.

Next, check `Font{\down}Show WinExe' in {\DVIWindo} to see what `port'
{\DVIWindo} is using when calling {\DVIPSONE}. If it is something like
ÛNE00:Û, try and find out its `shared name' --- typically a UNC that starts
with Û\\Û. Try printing to that shared name.  

The easiest way to do this may be to
use `Preferences{\down}Command Line{\down}DVIPSONE' to add
the Û-d=\\foo\barÛ command line option.  Equivalently, add a
line like ÛDVIPSONE= -d=\\foo\barÛ to the [Window] section of {\dviwindoini}.

You could also print using the {\DVIPSONE} entry in the `TeX Menu.' 
Edit this entry to add Û-d=\\foo\barÛ (or whatever) after the Ûdvipsone.exeÛ.  

For additional information on network printing issues please refer to
Ûnetprint.txtÛ in Ûdoc-miscÛ.

\subsect{{\yandyBold} TeX Flags and Arguments}

{\yandy} TeX understands the following command line arguments \& flags. Note that these items are {\it case sensitive}:

\blist
\item Û?Û --- Show basic usage summary.

\item Û8Û --- Truncate file names to {\DOS} $8+3$ format (FAT). {\DOS}
normally truncates file names to its $8+3$ file name convention. Under
Windows~NT and Windows~95/98, however, long file names are not truncated ---
which is, of course, normally an advantage. 
%
But if you have a dual-boot system with files stored on {\FAT} directories,
then {\yandy} TeX will not find files whose names have been truncated on the
file system (such as Ûtex.poolÛ, Ûlcircle10.tfmÛ, and Ûlcirclew10.tfmÛ. In
that case, use the Û-8Û flag to truncate such long file names in {\yandy} TeX.

\item ÛaÛ --- Write {\AUX} file in the specified folder (alternatively, set the environment variable {\TEXAUX}).

\item ÛcÛ --- Don't look first in current directory for {\TFM} files.

\item ÛCÛ --- Don't look first in current directory for input files.

\item ÛdÛ --- Do not convert Û\Û to / in format and file names. The default is to allow Û\Û in the first argument on the command line, and hence {\it not\/} treat tokens starting with Û\Û as {\TeX} control sequences. This applies to the second argument also, if the first is a format file. The conversion also applies to directories specified in environment variables. You can turn off this conversion of Û\Û to / using Û-dÛ on the command line. (Note that {\DOS} treats / in file names just like Û\Û --- except at the command prompt, where / indicates that an argument follows).

\item ÛeÛ --- Hyphenation hash table size (for ini{\TeX} only). The default allocation of 1009 for hyphenation exceptions is typically one or two orders of magnitude more than is needed. You can, however, change the table size via Ûe=...Û. Suppose, for example, that you want to read in a hyphenation dictionary of 25,000 words. Then you might want to use Û-e=30000Û on the command line (i.e., about 25\% more than 25,000, to reduce the incidence of collisions in the hash table). This makes it possible to completely control hyphenation, {\it without\/} relying on Û\patternsÛ.

\item ÛhÛ --- Hyphenation pattern trie size (for ini{\TeX} only). Controlling the size of the hyphenation pattern trie via Û-h=...Û can come in handy if you need to load up hyphenation patterns for several languages.

\item ÛHÛ --- Set horizontal tab step interval for input lines (e.g., Û-H=8Û). {\TeX} normally treats a horizontal tab as a single `space' character. This can be annoying when reproducing verbatim program examples, where horizontal tabs may be used for spacing. With this flag set to Û-H=Û\angi{tab-step}, each tab is replaced by one or more spaces as needed to move to the next column which is a multiple of \angi{tab-step} characters from the beginning of the line. In many cases editors display program text with an implicit \angi{tab-step} of 8, although C language code often is displayed with an implicit \angi{tab-step} of 4 instead to provide for deeper nesting of levels.

\item ÛiÛ --- Start up as ini{\TeX}: create format file (use Û\dumpÛ at Û*Û prompt).

\item ÛIÛ --- Do not use format-specific {\TEXINPUTS} folder list. With this flag set, {\yandy} TeX will {\it not} look for an environment variable with a name equal to that of the format used (e.g., {\PLAIN} or {\LPLAIN} or {\LATEX}), even if such a variable is defined. It will instead always look for the {\TEXINPUTS} variable itself.

\item ÛjÛ --- Convert from IBM OEM to Windows encoding when showing `non
{\ASCII}' characters.  See also Û-wÛ.

\item ÛJÛ --- Don't show paragraph line breaking statistics in log file.

\item ÛkÛ --- Use key-replacement table for input characters. A keyboard replacement table (see section 4.1) can be set up from the command line, using Û-k=Û\angi{file-name}.

\item ÛKÛ --- Suppress all extensions (revert to Knuthian {\TeX}). {\yandy} TeX has several extensions of `standard' {\TeX} that may provide additional on-screen and log file output (for example, showing missing character error information). Use the Û-KÛ command line flag if you want to revert to a completely `standard' {\TeX}. 

\item ÛlÛ --- Write {\LOG} file in the specified folder (alternatively, set the {\DVIWindo} environment variable {\TEXLOG}).

\item ÛLÛ --- Show file name (as well as line number) when reporting an error. Output is in the standard form produced by many C compilers. This makes it possible to use editor commands that read in the corresponding source file and position the cursor on the line in question. In Epsilon, for example, you can use ÛAlt+X next-errorÛ --- which may be bound to a key (e.g., Alt+E) for convenience (using ÛAlt+X bind-to-keyÛ). {\sc warning}: Let {\TeX} finish before editing and writing out a new version of the source file. Remember that {\TeX} still has the source file open when it reports the error!

\item ÛmÛ --- Initial memory size in kilo-words (for ini{\TeX} only). {\yandy} TeX allows most of {\TeX}'s various memory spaces to grow dynamically, but the definition of {\TeX} itself does {\it not\/} provide for growth in main memory while in ini{\TeX} mode. {\yandy} TeX's default is to allocate 64k words (i.e., 512k bytes) initially for {\TeX}'s main memory. In the unlikely event that you run out of memory while creating a new format, use Û-m=...Û to increase the initial allocation. Note that this allocation is written into the format file and so also becomes the initial allocation when that format is used later (although at that point main memory {\it can\/} grow without constraint). If you have a PC with relatively little free extended memory, you may wish to create formats with small initial memory (8k words for plain {\TeX}). You can then run small {\TeX} jobs in less than 1.6 megabytes of free extended memory. {\yandy} TeX's speed is reduced a few percent when the initial memory allocation is that small, however. (Conversely, if you have lots of memory and often run large jobs, you may wish to use a larger initial allocation to gain some speed.)

\item ÛMÛ --- Do not show `missing character' information on screen. Missing character information was of little importance when everyone just used Computer Modern fonts with their fixed `TeX Text' encoding scheme (which used all 128 positions on the 7-bit character code space). But now missing character information is {\it very\/} important for debugging font encoding problems, problems with {\TFM} files, and so on. Use the Û-MÛ command line flag to turn this feature off.

\item ÛnÛ --- Do not allow non-{\ASCII} character codes in source files (complain if byte Û>Û 127). Although {\yandy} TeX can, of course, handle arbitrary character codes from 0 to 255 in both input and output, sometimes input files use only the {\ASCII} range 32 to 127, and any non-{\ASCII} character indicates a typo. This flag asks {\yandy} TeX to check for such characters in input.

\item ÛNÛ --- Don't show character code in decimal (in addition to hex).

\item ÛoÛ --- Write {\DVI} file in the specified folder (alternatively, set the {\DVIWindo} environment variable {\TEXDVI}).

\item ÛOÛ --- Don't show format file name in log file.

\item ÛpÛ --- Allow use of Û\patternsÛ after loading formats. Normally {\TeX} refuses to allow redefinition of hyphenation patterns once a format has been dumped (or once typesetting has begun). It can, however, be very convenient to build {\TeX} formats incrementally, by using ini{\TeX} with an existing format specified on the command line. Use the Û-pÛ command line flag to allow Û\patternsÛ to flush previous definitions of hyphenation patterns.

\item ÛPÛ --- Set TeX's default rule width to the specified value (default is 26214, or 0.4pt).

\item ÛQÛ --- Quiet mode (omit all stops and omit terminal output).

\item ÛrÛ --- Do not allow Mac line termination (i.e., `return' instead of `newline'). The default is to allow `return' as a line terminator (as well as `newline' {\it and\/} `return' followed by `newline'). This is handy when dealing with files ({\TeX} source as well as {\EPS} files) ported from Macintosh or Unix. You can force {\yandy} TeX to instead open files in {\it text\/} mode using the Û-rÛ command line flag; with this flag in force, `return' alone will {\it not\/} act as a line terminator (i.e., standard {\DOS} behavior).

\item ÛRÛ --- Run mode (omit all stops).

\item ÛSÛ --- Scroll mode (omit error stops).

\item ÛTÛ --- Normal (default) mode (stops at every opportunity to interact).

\item ÛvÛ --- Be verbose (show implementation version number).

\item ÛwÛ --- Do not show non-{\ASCII} character codes in hex. {\TeX}
normally shows non-{\ASCII} characters in screen output using hexadecimal
notation 
% (e.g., Û^^feÛ 
(e.g., {\tt \char142\char142ÛfeÛ }
is character code 254). Use this flag to instead show
the character `as is.' This is useful if the font encoding you specify is
that used by the underlying operating system (e.g., local {\DOS} code page
in the case of {\DOS}, in which case accented characters will display
properly); see also Û-jÛ

\item ÛWÛ --- Don't use {\dviwindoini} for environment variable lookup.

\item ÛxÛ --- Use non-{\ASCII} input character mapping table (Ûxchr[]Û). The command line customization of the Ûxchr[]Û array comes in handy when using non-English keyboards (see section 4.1). Each line in the file specified contains two numbers defining one entry in the Ûxchr[]Û array. Input bytes matching the second number are replaced with the first number. For example, if you have the two lines Û146 39Û and Û145 96Û in the mapping file, then the internal {\ASCII} code 146 will be translated to 39 for output of error messages, file names and log files, and the internal {\ASCII} code 145 will be translated to 96. Conversely, in input the numeric code 39 (`quoteright' in {\ASCII}) will be translated to 146 (`quoteright' in Windows {\ANSI}), while numeric code 96 (`quoteleft' in {\ASCII}) will be translated to 145 (`quoteleft' in Windows {\ANSI}). Character codes not mentioned in the file are not translated. Ideally you would want to set up the Ûxchr[]Û array as a {\it permutation}, so that {\TeX} can construct an exact inverse for the Ûxord[]Û array which is used on input. (See {\tensl The {\TeX}book} for additional details.) Note that you typically don't want to use the Û-xÛ argument while building formats, since the source files for formats mostly are set up for {\ASCII}.

% \item ÛzÛ --- Do not discard Ctrl+Z at end of file; treat as character (code 26). {\yandy} TeX normally reads its input files in binary mode so it can deal with various line terminations, and so it can handle {\it all\/} 8-bit characters including Ctrl+Z. Because pre-{\DOS} text files on IBM PC compatibles used to be terminated with Ctrl+Z, {\yandy} TeX normally silently discards a Ctrl+Z if found at the very end of the file. 

\item ÛZÛ --- Show {\TFM} file names in log file (as well as source file names). Don't be surprised to see some {\TFM} files listed more than once. {\TeX} needs to read copies of the {\TFM} file for every size at which a font is used. Also remember that {\TeX} format files contain `frozen' font metric information. If font metric information for a font is incorporated in a format file, then {\TeX} will ignore any changes you make to the {\TFM} file. You'll be able to tell whether or not a {\TFM} file is being read by looking in the log file.

\item ÛvÛ --- be verbose. List font file names and {\DVI} file pages as they are being processed. (In the default non-verbose mode, a `*' is used to denote each font file, while a `.' is used to denote each page processed.)

\item ÛVÛ --- show complete font tables (useful for debugging font problems)

\item ÛWÛ --- toggle whether or not Ctrl+D will be put in at end of PostScript output (normally done when going direct to printer, but not to file)

\endlist

\noindent {\it Several `extended' flags take an asterisk after the leading `Û-Û':}

\blist
\item Û*2Û --- remap `space' (32 to 195, 13 to 176, 0 to 161)

\item Û*3Û --- do not give up after seeing 64 errors

\item Û*4Û --- show Ûcounter[0]Û$-$Ûcounter[1]Û in Û%%PageÛ {\DSC} (instead of just Ûcounter[0]Û)

\item Û*6Û --- do not write ÛpdfmarkÛs to PostScript output

\item Û*7Û --- suppress background in ÛimagemaskÛ (monochrome images)

\item Û*8Û --- send error output to ÛstdoutÛ instead of ÛstderrÛ (so can redirect)

\item Û*bÛ --- keep black (suppress effect of Û\special{color ...}Û)

\item Û*BÛ --- use `return'$+$`newline' (default uses just `newline') in PostScript output (this will however break binary inclusions in {\EPS} files)

\item Û*cÛ --- allow color: allow use of ÛcolorimageÛ operator for {\TIFF}	(even though ÛcolorimageÛ is not a standard PostScript level 1 operator)

\item Û*EÛ --- do not check encoding for text fonts versus {\TFM} file checksum

\item Û*fÛ --- check whether fonts are loaded on printer before printing job (shows error page if a font is not found)

\item Û*GÛ --- make 1-byte adjustment for error in GhostScript {\TIFF} files

\item Û*HÛ --- do not wrap Ûps:Û code (i.e., treat like Ûps::Û) --- more like {\DVIPS}

\item Û*iÛ --- do not insert fonts specified by Û%%IncludeFonts: ...Û in {\EPS} files

\item Û*IÛ --- bind all procedures at top of page (this is a speed up, but might not be safe when doing page imposition, color separation, etc.)

\item Û*lÛ --- do not force long form of octal strings (which is needed for Apple LaserWriter)

\item Û*LÛ --- output is for PostScript level 2 (use compression for inserted {\TIFF} images); see also Û*ZÛ

\item Û*SÛ --- Allow figure inclusion Û\specialÛ used by Scientific Word
% (Ûps:...Û)

\item Û*TÛ --- force standard form of encoding vector (write out in full)

\item Û*WÛ --- try and prevent long lines in inserted PostScript and {\EPS} files

\item Û*xÛ --- add random prefix to font names

\item Û*XÛ --- replace aliases from {\texfontsmap} up front (not after failure to find {\PFB} file)

\item Û*ZÛ --- allow only {\ASCII}85 coding of {\TIFF} file derived images (not actual compression); see also Û*LÛ
\endlist

\noindent If you use verbatim PostScript you need to use ÛjÛ. If you use color, then you need to use the command line flag Û*cÛ (and do not use Û*bÛ). And if you have trouble with a clone PostScript interpreter, try removing some of the default optimizations (ÛOÛ, ÛLÛ, ÛYÛ, Û*TÛ, ÛPÛ), and do {\it not\/} turn on any of the optional optimizations (ÛNÛ, ÛZÛ, Û*lÛ).  Also try using Û*sÛ if you have problems with inserted {\EPS} figures.  Please notify {\yandy} if you can identify which optimization a particular clone is unable to handle.  We'd like to (i) complain to the source, (ii) provide a suitable workaround if possible, and (iii) warn other users about the problem.

\subsub{DVIPSONE arguments} Command line {\it arguments\/} for {\DVIPSONE} are also {\it case sensitive}. Here is the complete list:

\blist
\item ÛaÛ --- {\AFM} metric file search path (not normally needed; used only if font substituted for --- better to set {\DVIWindo} environment variable {\AFMPATH} if required)

\item ÛAÛ --- preamble file path (better to set {\DVIWindo} environment variable {\PREPATH})

\item ÛbÛ --- beginning of page range (logical; Ûcount[0]Û $-$ {\TeX} page number)

\item ÛBÛ --- beginning of page range (physical; sequential % {\DVI} 
page count)

\item ÛcÛ --- number of copies (uncollated). See also Û*qÛ, below.

\item ÛCÛ --- number of copies (collated --- {\it slow\/} printing). See also Û*qÛ, below.

\item ÛdÛ --- destination for output. Output gets sent to the designated device (ÛPRNÛ, ÛLPT1Û, ÛLPT2Û, ÛLPT3Û, ÛAUXÛ, ÛCOM1Û, ÛCOM2Û or a file). If the argument ends in `Û:Û' or starts with `Û\\Û' then it is considered a direct connection to a printer. If the argument is omitted, the output gets sent to a file in the current folder with the same name as the {\DVI} file, but with extension Û.psÛ. Another useful destination argument is ÛNULÛ, which makes it possible to run a {\DVI} file through {\DVIPSONE} without producing printer {\it or\/} file output --- a quick way to determine whether the program can find all the required fonts and included illustrations.

\item ÛDÛ --- size of PostScript dictionary ÛdvidictÛ (default 256)

\item ÛeÛ --- end of page range (logical; Ûcount[0]Û $-$ {\TeX} page number). The arguments Û-b=...Û and Û-e=...Û may be used more than once, in which case ÛbÛ's and ÛeÛ's must alternate, although the sequence may start and end on either a ÛbÛ or an ÛeÛ. If you only specify a beginning page, everything from that page on gets printed. If you only specify an ending page, everything up to (and including) that page is printed.

(In {\TeX}, there may be several pages with the same Ûcount[0]Û `page number.' With Û-bÛ and Û-eÛ, you can specify which `page group' you are referring to by appending a colon and the number of the page group. Each page group consists of pages with an ascending sequence of page numbers. A new group starts when a page number is not larger (in absolute value) than the previous page number. To select the page range 4--7 in the first group, for example, use Û-b=4:1 -e=7Û.)

\item ÛEÛ --- end of page range (physical; sequential {\DVI} page count). The Û-B=...Û and Û-E=...Û arguments may also be used more than once. However, page ranges must be specified {\it either\/} using the lower case letters {\it or\/} the upper case letters --- you're not allowed to mix the two forms.

\item ÛfÛ --- font search path (where {\PFB} files are located; better to set {\DVIWindo} environment variable {\PSFONTS})

\item ÛFÛ --- add specified prefix to all font names

\item ÛiÛ --- {\EPS} file search path (better to set environment variable {\PSPATH}). The {\DVI} file specifies a fully qualified file name for an inserted illustration, and {\DVIPSONE} attempts to open the file using that name. If this fails and an illustration path exists, the pathname is stripped off the file name, and the result appended to each of the paths in the illustration pathname in turn. If this also fails, then the file is searched for in the folder from which the {\DVI} file was read --- and finally in the current folder. The rationale is that {\DVIPSONE} may be running on a computer other than the one on which {\TeX} was run to create the {\DVI} file; thus, the folder structure may not be the same as it was when the {\DVI} file was created.

\item ÛGÛ --- encoding vector path (better to set environment variable {\VECPATH})

\item ÛHÛ --- font substitution file path (better to set environment variable {\SUBPATH})

\item ÛlÛ --- paper size. Acceptable values are ÛletterÛ, ÛnoteÛ, ÛlegalÛ, ÛfolioÛ, ÛledgerÛ, ÛtabloidÛ, ÛexecutiveÛ, Ûa2Û, Ûa3Û, Ûa4Û, Ûa5Û, Ûb3Û, Ûb4Û, Ûb5Û, and ÛquartoÛ. You may also use \angi{w}Û*Û\angi{h} where \angi{w} and \angi{h} are width and height in points. The default is ÛletterÛ format on PostScript printers. Note that PostScript commands for paper size specification tend to be device dependent.

\item ÛmÛ --- magnification (if used twice: $x$ and $y$ magnification). Scale the output by the specified number, which need not be an integer (the default is 1.0).

\item ÛoÛ --- counter-clockwise rotation about the center of the page (in degrees); thus, to obtain landscape printing, specify plus or minus 90.

\item ÛpÛ --- {\PFM} metric file search path (not normally needed; used only if font substituted for --- better to set {\DVIWindo} environment variable {\PFMPATH} if required)

(In most cases, {\DVIPSONE} doesn't need font metric files {\it at all}. And when it does, only {\it one\/} of the possible forms need be present. If {\DVIPSONE} is run on the same computer system as that used to produce the {\DVI} file, then {\TFM} files must exist for the fonts used, since {\TeX} had to have access to them. But {\DVIPSONE} may be running on another system, so it is useful to allow for other sources of font metric information, particularly for fonts other than Computer Modern. {\DVIPSONE} first tries to find a {\TFM} file, because {\TFM} files are compact and can be read quickly. If this fails, it tries to find an {\AFM} file. It only looks for {\PFM} files if it can't find {\TFM} or {\AFM} files.)

\item ÛsÛ --- font substitution file to use (declare fonts printer resident,
reencode fonts, etc). Font substitution files (and any encoding vectors
specified therein) are first searched for in the same folder as the {\DVI}
file being processed, and if not found there, in the home folder of
{\DVIPSONE}. This makes it convenient to override a general-purpose font
substitution file in the {\DVIPSONE} folder with a customized file of the
same name in the folder of the {\DVI} file being processed. More than one
substitution file may be specified by using Û-sÛ again.

\item ÛtÛ --- {\TFM} metric file search path (not normally needed; used only if font substituted for --- better to set environment variable {\TFMPATH} if required)

\item ÛwÛ --- prolog file to be inserted (may occur more than once)

\item ÛxÛ --- shift in $x$. Move the output to the right by an amount in points (72 per inch) specified by the argument.

\item ÛyÛ --- shift in $y$. Move the output down by an amount in points (72 per inch) specified by the argument.
\endlist

\noindent {\it Several `extended' arguments take an asterisk after the leading `Û-Û':}

\blist
\item Û*AÛ --- divide all coordinates by specified number (useful for getting around bugs in Viper based RIPs)

\item Û*CÛ --- minimum rule thickness (in scaled points)

\item Û*DÛ --- Add extra {\DSC} comment to the head of the PostScript file (e.g., Û-*D=%%DocumentColor:Û).

\item Û*hÛ --- specify frequency of halftone screen (default: use printer's default). Û-*h=Û\angi{n}Û+Û means use $n$ or higher (if default is higher); Û-*h=Û\angi{n}Û-Û means use $n$ or lower (if default is lower). Can also specify screen angle with second argument: Û-h=73:45Û, Û-h=73+45Û, Û-h=73-45Û

\item Û*JÛ --- default dots per inch for {\TIFF} files that don't specify resolution

\item Û*PÛ --- use specified ÛpapersizeÛ for defining Û%%BoundingBoxÛ
\endlist

\subsect{DVIWindo Command Line Arguments}

In `normal' use, {\DVIWindo} needs no command line parameters (and cannot be
passed such parameters). However, it can be invoked (a) directly (by double
clicking on the {\DVIWindo} icon), (b) by double clicking on a {\DVI} file,
(c) by dragging and dropping a DVI file on an iconized {\DVIWindo}, (d) from
another Windows application, using `WinExec,' or (e) from a {\PIF} file. And
in the last two cases, you {\it can\/} supply a command line to indicate what
{\DVIWindo} is supposed to do. For example, you can ask the program to show a
selected page of a specified document, or to print a selected page range of
one or more {\DVI} files.

{\DVIWindo}'s command line flags and arguments, like {\DVIPSONE}'s, are preceded by Û-Û. Any item that does {\it not\/} start with Û-Û is considered a file name. File name(s) should come after all command line flags and command line arguments. 

You can call {\DVIWindo} from another application to show a {\DVI} file. To
do so, simply specify

\beginlines
\angi{DVI-file}
\endlines

\noindent at the command prompt, providing the full path to the file.

The file extension Û.dviÛ is associated with {\DVIWindo}
during installation.  This also means you can click on a link
to a {\DVI} file on the web in your browser and have it download
the {\DVI} file and launch {\DVIWindo} automatically.

You can have the {\DVI} file opened at a specific page. Just specify

\beginlines
Û-p=Û\angi{n} \angi{DVI-file}
\endlines

\noindent where \angi{n} is the desired page. Similarly, to call {\DVIWindo}
from another application just to print files, use the Û-wÛ command line
argument. For example:  

\beginlines
Û-w="Apple LaserWriter II NT",pscript,COM1:Û \angi{DVI-file}
\endlines

\noindent Here, the first argument to ÛwÛ is the device, the second is the driver and the third is the port (in the form found in {\winini}). The device name must be enclosed in double quotes if it contains spaces. The default printer is used if the device, driver and port are omitted (i.e., if only Û-wÛ appears).

When printing, you can also specify the number of copies using Û-c=Û\angi{n}, and a page range using Û-b=Û\angi{begin} and Û-e=Û\angi{end}. Page order can be reversed using Û-rÛ, and you can print alternating pages using Û-sÛ, or only odd pages using Û-gÛ, or only even pages using Û-hÛ. Finally, several files can be printed in one call, using wildcard characters in \angi{DVI-file}.

\subsect{Maintaining DVIWindo's Preferences}

{\DVIWindo}'s preferences are stored in the [Window] section of {\dviwindoini}. The following items are normally found in that section:

\blist
\item ÛDefaultsÛ --- {\DVI} file selection defaults.

\endlist

\noindent The {\dviwindoini} file has an [Environment] section which overrides any {\DOS} environment variables set for {\DVIWindo}, {\DVIPSONE} and {\yandy} TeX. To disable this feature, set the {\DOS} environment variable {\USEDVIWINDOINI} to zero in your {\autoexecbat} file:

\beginlines
ÛSET USEDVIWINDOINI=0Û
\endlines

\subsect{Fine Points of DVIWindo's `TeX' Menu}

Following is some additional information on setup and maintenance of {DVIWindo}'s `TeX' menu.

\blist
\item When an application is called from the `TeX' menu, the current working folder is set either to (i) the folder specified by ÛWorkingDirectory=...Û in the [Window] section of {\dviwindoini} (if you specified a common working directory during installation), or (ii) the folder of the file being processed. So, if you do not have a ÛWorkingDirectory=...Û entry and you are using the Û#Û syntax to search for a file, then the current folder gets set to the folder in which that file is found.

\item Suppose you want to set the current folder to the one in which a particular file is found, but you also want to pass the name of that file {\it without\/} path or extension to a batch file. Just use the Û*Û option:

\beginlines
{\parindent=1pc
ÛMyHack=mybatch @.tex *Û
}
\endlines

\noindent This construct calls Ûmybatch.batÛ with two arguments, the second being the name of the file without path or extension. It also sets the current folder (unless ÛWorkingDirectoryÛ is set).
\endlist

\noindent As noted elsewhere, the `TeX' menu's setup gets maintained in the [Applications] section of {\dviwindoini}. Following is a rather lengthy sample [Applications] section, showing lots of possibilities.

\subsect{Flags and arguments for AFMtoTFM}

The {\AFMtoTFM} utility, found in the Û\utilÛ subfolder of your main {\yandy} program folder, provides an extensive array of options that you can use when creating {\TFM} files from {\AFM} sources. Here is a complete list (note that flags and arguments are {\it case sensitive\/}):

\vskip .25in\noindent {\bf Command line flags:}
\blist
\item Û?Û --- show usage summary

\item Û0Û --- do not ignore zero width kerns

\item Û1Û --- do not add some `TeX Text' characters (16--32) if Windows {\ANSI}

\item ÛaÛ --- insert 5 standard {\TeX} f-ligatures and 6 pseudo ligatures for endash, emdash, questiondown, exclamdown, quotedblleft, quotedblright

\item ÛbÛ --- backward compatability (old style {\TFM}) limit to 255 kern pairs

\item ÛBÛ --- suppress bold; pretend font is not bold (for Textures)

\item ÛdÛ --- insert 5 pseudo ligatures for guillemotleft, guillemotright, quotedblbase, lslash, Lslash

\item ÛEÛ --- direct error output to ÛstdoutÛ instead of ÛstderrÛ (so can redirect error output to file)

\item ÛfÛ --- insert just the 6 standard pseudo ligatures (those inserted by ÛaÛ, minus f-ligatures)

\item ÛIÛ --- suppress italic; pretend font is not italic (for Textures)

\item ÛjÛ --- insert pseudo ligatures for the 58 standard accented characters

\item ÛLÛ --- allow ligatures for fixed pitch font (default is to suppress ligatures for fixed width fonts)

\item ÛMÛ --- use Macintosh $5+3+3$\dots contracted font name for ÛFontIDÛ

\item ÛnÛ --- suppress ligatures listed in {\AFM} file (default: use ligatures in {\AFM} file unless fixed pitch font)

\item ÛqÛ --- do not allow ligatures based on `dotlessi' (e.g., Û\'\iÛ)

\item ÛQÛ --- allow ligatures based on `i' (e.g., Û\'iÛ)

\item ÛSÛ --- add glyphs borrowed from Symbol font if Macintosh encoding used

\endlist

\subsect{Batch and PIF files}

You will normally not have to modify the basic batch files used by the
{\yandy} TeX System. But the example provided by these batch files may help
if you choose to set up batch files for additional entries in {\DVIWindo}'s
`TeX' menu, as shown above. (Linking to a program via a batch file can often
provide more flexibility than calling the program directly.) 

% In the {\PIF} Editor (Windows~NT 3.5x) or the
In the Properties dialog % (Windows~95/98 or Windows~NT 4.x) 
for a batch file or program, the optional
parameter Û?Û forces Windows to prompt you to supply a target file name. 
You can also select whether you want the program or batch file to run full
screen or windowed, and whether the window will be automatically closed upon
exit.  You get to the Properties dialog by right clicking on the 
title bar of the window when the console application is running.
This creates or modifies an existing {\PIF} file.

% It is, in fact, {\it not\/} necessary to specify a Program File Name at all,
% only a Window Title. Although the PIF Editor complains when it doesn't see a
% Program File Name, it nevertheless accepts such an entry. As long as the
% Window Title is correct, the resulting PIF file will do what you specify ---
% and will not require alteration even if you later change the location of the
% program or batch file involved. (The location would, of course, have to be a
% folder on your {\PATH} in both cases.) 

% ®MDRV¯does this need to be revised in view of Windows~95/98 ?®MDNM¯

Here is Ûtex.batÛ (if your main {\yandy} program directory is something other than Ûc:\yandyÛ, the line containing the directory name will be appropriately modified):

\beginlines
Û@echo offÛ
Ûrem show current directory and command lineÛ
ÛchdirÛ
Ûecho %0 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9Û
Ûc:\yandy\yandytex\yandytex.exe -v -L %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9Û
Ûif not errorlevel 1 goto endÛ
Ûrem pause, but only when run from command prompt in WindowsÛ
Ûset | find "windir=" > NULÛ
Ûif not errorlevel 1 pauseÛ
Û:endÛ
\endlines

\noindent And here is Ûlatex2e.batÛ (Ûlatex209.batÛ is similar). We don't really need this one, since the Û+latexÛ can merely be passed as the first argument to Ûtex.batÛ (as above, a line may be different if your main {\yandy} program directory is something other than Ûc:\yandyÛ):

\beginlines
Û@echo offÛ
Ûrem show current directoryÛ
ÛchdirÛ
Ûecho %0 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9Û
ÛC:\yandy\yandytex\yandytex.exe +latex -v -L %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9Û
Ûif not errorlevel 1 goto endÛ
Ûrem pause, but only when run in DOS box in WindowsÛ
Ûset | find "windir=" > NULÛ
Ûif not errorlevel 1 pauseÛ
Û:endÛ
\endlines

\subsect{TPIC Command List}

{\TPIC} commands are 2-letter words followed in some cases by numeric arguments. They are generated by some {\LaTeX} style files such as {\eepicsty}; you can also invoke {\TPIC} commands directly, as in

\beginlines
Û\special{Û\angi{command} [\angi{argument(s)}]Û}Û.
\endlines

\noindent The command words are meant to be mnemonic (but are mostly mnemonic only in a somewhat misleading way):

\blist
\item Ûpn Û\angi{n} --- set pen width for stroking to \angi{n} milli-inches.

\item ÛbkÛ --- flag next graphic to be filled, and set gray level for fill to 1 (black).

\item ÛwhÛ --- flag next graphic to be filled, and set gray level for fill to 0 (white).

\item Ûsh [Û\angi{g}Û]Û --- flag next graphic to be filled, and set gray level for fill to \angi{g} if optional argument is specified; otherwise set gray level to 0.5 (the default).

\item Ûtx Û\angi{hex} --- use specified bit pattern for filling. This is typically translated to an equivalent gray level.

\item Ûpa Û\angi{x} \angi{y} --- add the point \angi{x} \angi{y} to the current path. That is, move to \angi{x} \angi{y} if this is the first point in new path, or else add a line extending to \angi{x} \angi{y} to the path being accumulated.

\item ÛfpÛ --- stroke a solid polygonal line defined using a sequence of ÛpaÛ commands. If shading was requested using ÛbkÛ, ÛgrÛ or ÛwhÛ, then also fill the shape defined by closing the figure.

\item ÛipÛ --- fill the polygonal shape that was defined by a sequence of ÛpaÛ commands. Use the gray level specified by ÛbkÛ, ÛgrÛ or ÛwhÛ. The shape is first closed if necessary.

\item Ûda Û\angi{l} --- stroke a dashed polygonal line defined using a sequence of ÛpaÛ commands. Argument \angi{l} is the length of dashes, and also the inter-dash interval (specified in {\it inches\/}). The length of the dash is adjusted so that each line starts and ends with a full-length dash. If shading was requested using ÛbkÛ, ÛgrÛ or ÛwhÛ, then also fill the shape defined by closing the figure.

\item Ûdt Û\angi{l} --- stroke a dotted polygonal line defined using a sequence of ÛpaÛ commands. Argument \angi{l} is the interval between dots (specified in {\it inches\/}), which is adjusted so that each line starts and ends with a dot. If shading was requested using ÛbkÛ, ÛgrÛ or ÛwhÛ, then also fill the shape defined by closing the figure.

\item Ûsp [Û\angi{l}Û]Û --- stroke a quadratic spline through the midpoints of the lines defined using a sequence of ÛpaÛ commands. The spline starts with a straight line from the first point to the midpoint of the first line. The spline ends with a straight line from the midpoint of the last line to the last point. If the optional \angi{l} is omitted (or zero), the spline is stroked solid. If \angi{l} is positive, it gives the length of the dashes and the interval between dashes to be used (in {\it inches\/}). If \angi{l} is negative, its magnitude indicates the interval between dots to be used (in {\it inches\/}).

\item Ûar Û\angi{xo} \angi{yo} \angi{xr} \angi{yr} \angi{sa} \angi{ea} --- stroke an elliptical arc. The center of the ellipse is at \angi{xo} \angi{yo}. The major and minor axes are aligned with the coordinate-system axes. The horizontal and vertical semi-axes have lengths \angi{xr} and \angi{yr}, respectively. The arc goes clockwise from the starting angle \angi{sa} to the ending angle \angi{ea}. If shading is requested using ÛbkÛ, ÛgrÛ or ÛwhÛ, then also fill the shape defined by closing the figure.

\item Ûia Û\angi{xo} \angi{yo} \angi{xr} \angi{yr} \angi{sa} \angi{ea} --- fill elliptical arc after closing the figure. Use the gray level specified by ÛbkÛ, ÛgrÛ or ÛwhÛ. The center of the ellipse is at \angi{xo} \angi{yo}. The major and minor axes are aligned with the coordinate-system axes. The horizontal and vertical semi-axes have lengths \angi{xr} and \angi{yr}, respectively. The arc goes clockwise from the starting angle \angi{sa} to the ending angle \angi{ea}.
\endlist

\noindent Note that {\TPIC} state information, such as pen width and gray level, can {\it not\/} be carried across page boundaries; for otherwise, page independence would be lost.

Be aware of several issues when using the {\TPIC} commands, especially if maximum portability is a concern. Always specify the pen-width using ÛpnÛ before starting to put together a new polygonal path or drawing an elliptical arc. And always explicitly set the gray level if filling is desired, using ÛbkÛ, ÛwhÛ or ÛshÛ.

\subsect{Modifying CM Text Fonts for TeX 'n ANSI Encoding}

We do not particularly recommend modifying the Computer Modern text fonts so that on-the-fly reencoding applies to them. Although doing so has some advantages --- such as providing access to ready-made accented characters --- there are several drawbacks. One is that the {\CM} text fonts lack several glyphs users expect to find in text fonts (such as left and right braces, less, greater, backslash, underscore, bar, quotesingle, quotedbl, asciitilde, and asciicircumflex). Another is that {\DVI} files made for the modified {\CM} fonts will not be portable: users employing {\CM} fonts in the `normal' way cannot use DVI files made for the modified fonts, and vice versa. And perhaps most seriously, by modifying {\CM} text font for TeX 'n {\ANSI} encoding you lose the 11 upright upper case Greek letters, since they are buried in the text fonts (but see below for a workaround).

If you do use modified {\CM} fonts, you should add Û\input texnansiÛ to your source files. Note, too, that you do not want to touch the {\it math\/} fonts --- the ones whose names start with CMEX, CMMI, CMSY, CMMIB or CMBSY. Finally, note that only {\DVIWindo} supports on-the-fly reencoding. If you want to reencode your {\CM} fonts for use with other Windows applications, see section 2.5.

If all of this hasn't dissuaded you, proceed as follows:

You need the original {\AFM} files, found on diskette C of the 3-diskette {\CM} font set from {\yandy}. You should build up the new {\PFB} and {\PFM} files in an empty temporary folder. Assuming that all your {\PFB} files are in Ûc:\psfontsÛ and all your {\AFM} files have been copied to Ûc:\psfonts\afmÛ,

\nlist
\item From a command prompt, create an empty temporary folder and make that the current folder.

\item `Standardize' the {\PFB} files (i.e., replace the encoding with Û/Encoding StandardEncoding defÛ) using the {\REENCODE} utility, as described in section 2.5.3. (Do {\it not\/} reencode to the encoding vector you want to use later.)

\item Make new {\PFM} files that are set up for Windows {\ANSI} encoding, using {\AFMtoPFM}. (Again, do {\it not\/} reencode to the encoding vector you want to use later.)

\item Make new {\TFM} files for {\TeX} (specifying the new encoding vector via Û-cÛ on the command line), and copy them to a folder in the list of folders specified by the {\TEXFONTS} environment variable.

\item From the {\ATM} Control Panel, select the {\CM} text fonts and click `Remove.'

\item From the {\ATM} Control Panel, click `Add.' Navigate to the temporary folder containing the new {\PFB} and {\PFM} files. Click `Add' again.

At this point, you can check whether everything has worked as expected by
using `Show Fonts' from the `Fonts' menu in {\DVIWindo}. You should see the
new character layout (as defined by the value of {\ENCODING}, including
ready-made accented characters. (If you have displayed Computer Modern fonts
since you launched Windows, but before you made the change, you may have to
exit and relaunch Windows for the changes to take hold.)  

% The 11 upper case upright Greek letters should have disappeared from the
% layout. If you want to avoid losing access to them in the modified {\CM} text
% fonts, you may want to make a modified version of {\texnansivec} --- say,
% {\cmanansivec} --- by copying the 11 lines for the upright Greek letters from
% {\textextvec}. You will then have to move `dotaccent,' `hungarumlaut,'
% `ogonek' and `fraction' elsewhere if you need access to those glyphs (and
% make a modified copy of {\texnansitex}).

% ugh, what a mess!

\item Add Û\input texnansiÛ  to your plain {\TeX} or {\LaTeX}~2.09
source files.  In {\LaTeXe} use instead Û\usepackage[LY1]{fontenc}Û.

\item To be politically correct you should also rename the modified fonts so
there is no confusion with the `original' {\CM} fonts. 
\endlist

\subsect{Using the Old Adobe LucidaMath Fonts}

Using Adobe's old LucidaMath fonts with {\TeX} is a nontrivial process. {\TeX} insists on using the character range 0--31. Adobe has moved the characters in that range to 161--195 instead, presumably assuming that no one would have real characters in the control character range. (This is called `Lucida Math remapping.')

To get around this problem first use the {\REENCODE} utility to reencode the math fonts so that the characters show up in 0--31. (Actually, for various reasons it makes sense to have the characters show up in {\it both\/} 0--31 and 161--195.)

When the re-encoding process is done, use {\AFMtoTFM} to make suitable {\TFM} files for use with {\TeX} --- again, using the {\AFM} files supplied with {\DVIPSONE}:

\beginlines
Ûafmtotfm -vx -c=mathsy lms.afmÛ
Ûafmtotfm -vx -c=mathit lmi.afmÛ
Ûafmtotfm -vx -c=mathex lme.afmÛ
\endlines

\noindent Now copy the new {\TFM} files to where {\TeX} expects to find them. You can then refer to the fonts in your {\TeX} source files, e.g.,

\beginlines
Û\font\lmi=lmiÛ
\endlines

\noindent For proper operation of the math fonts, use {\plaintex} (for plain
{\TeX}) or {\lfontstex} (for {\LaTeX} 2.09) as a template for making your own
definitions, simply replacing `cmsy*' with `lms,' `cmit*' with `lmi,' and
`cmex*' with `lme' at the appropriate point sizes. You can either load these
new definitions on top of an existing format such as plain {\TeX} or
{\LaTeX}, or make up a new format using ini{\TeX}. 

To use the fonts with {\DVIWindo}, you need to reencode the math fonts so that the characters show up both in 0--31 and 161--195. To get the required outline fonts:

\beginlines
Ûreencode -vtx -c=mathsy lms.pfbÛ
Ûreencode -vtx -c=mathit lmi.pfbÛ
Ûreencode -vtx -c=mathex lme.pfbÛ
\endlines

\noindent Here we assume that {\mathsyvec}, {\mathitvec} and {\mathexvec} are in the current folder or in the {\DVIPSONE} subfolder, and that the {\PFB} files are in the current folder. The ÛtÛ on the command line adds the Lucida Math remapping.

Note that the three Adobe LucidaMath fonts have {\it exactly\/} the same characters as the corresponding {\CM} math fonts (just in the `wrong' places) --- which is why you can use the {\CM} math font encoding vectors.

To get the required {\PFM} files:

\beginlines
Ûafmtopfm -vsdtx -c=mathsy lms.afmÛ
Ûafmtopfm -vsdtx -c=mathit lmi.afmÛ
Ûafmtopfm -vsdtx -c=mathex lme.afmÛ
\endlines

\noindent The ÛsÛ and ÛdÛ on the command line prevent reencoding to Windows {\ANSI}, and the ÛtÛ adds the Lucida Math remapping.

Now use the {\ATM} Control Panel to `Remove' the old LucidaMath fonts, if installed, then `Add' the three `new' LucidaMath fonts.

Some miscellaneous notes on Adobe's LucidaMath:

\blist
\item The names of the original {\PFB} and {\PFM} files are padded out to eight characters with underscores. This is for the benefit of Adobe font downloaders. You can omit these underscores on the command line --- the utilities will try to extend the name with underscores if they do not find the file right away. In fact, for use with {\TeX}, it is inconvenient to use font names with underscores. The {\TFM} file can use the name without the underscores, since {\DVIPSONE} and {\DVIWindo} will extend the name if needed.

\item The key to any reencoding project is consistency. Simply ensure that the {\PFB}, {\PFM} and {\TFM} files are all made using the same encoding, and make sure that both the {\PFB} and {\PFM} file have the duplicate LucidaMath encoding.

\item Be careful when replacing fonts to avoid confusing {\ATM} or Windows.
First `Remove' the old version if it has been installed. Also, make sure the
folder you install from contains {\it only\/} the new {\PFB} and {\PFM}
files, not the old ones. Otherwise confusion will reign since two different
{\PFB} or {\PFM} files will refer to the same Windows Face Name. 

\item Do not simply overwrite the {\PFB} and {\PFM} files, and never directly replace {\PFB} or {\PFM} files while Windows is running.

\section{Font Manipulation Package (Advertisement)}

If you have to delve deeper into font structure than even the standard
{\yandy} font utilities can take you, consider the {\yandy} Font
Manipulation Package.  

Suppose your needs are not met by simply reencoding a font: you might have to make a new font by combining glyphs from two existing fonts, for example. The {\FMP}'s command line utilities for modifying Type~1 fonts allow you to do that and much more, {\it without\/} damaging the fonts' `hinting' (crucial to quality rendering).

The utilities include tools for inserting characters from one font into another, for adding new accented characters, for adjusting character side-bearings and advance widths, for applying arbitrary linear transformations to glyphs, and more\dots.

% Price: \$95 educational, \$145 noneducational, plus shipping.

% remove initex.bat

\noindent Finally, here is Ûinitex.batÛ (again, if your main {\yandy} program directory is something other than Ûc:\yandyÛ, various lines will be appropriately modified):

Û@echo offÛ
Ûrem sample batch file for iniTeXÛ
Ûrem This is 'initex.bat' conveniently called from DVIWindo `TeX menu'Û
Ûrem Two command line arguments: (1) TeX source file, (2) DVIWindo Menu NameÛ
Ûrem e.g. `initex plain Plain'   `initex lplain LaTeX'   `initex latex LaTeX2e'Û
Ûrem Do *not* use an extension on the source file name (plain.tex say)Û
Ûrem For this to work as intended, the `[Applications]' section in the fileÛ
Ûrem DVIWINDO.INI in the Windows directory must be last.Û
Ûrem And utilities in their default location.Û
Ûrem Best to try and switch here to a temporary directory, ideally a RAM diskÛ
Ûif "%TEMP%" == "" goto notempÛ
Ûrem See whether can find cdd utility supplied with DVIWindoÛ
Ûrem Note: cdd.com is a utility that switches both drive and directoryÛ
Ûrem (but does not work for top-level directory in a drive)Û
Ûif exist c:\yandy\util\cdd.com c:\yandy\util\cdd %TEMP%Û
Ûif not exist c:\yandy\util\cdd.com cdd %TEMP%Û

Ûrem If this fails, then please copy cdd.com to somewhere on your PATHÛ
Û:notmpÛ
Ûrem show current directory so we know for sure where we areÛ
ÛchdirÛ
Ûrem Some sanity checks first!  Û
Ûrem This refers to DOS environment variable TEXFORMATSÛ
Ûif exist %TEXFORMATS%\nul goto fmtexistÛ
Ûecho Sorry, cannot find %TEXFORMATS% directoryÛ

Ûgoto endpauseÛ

Ûrem Find out where the Windows directory isÛ
Ûif not "%windir%" == "" set WINDIR=%windir%Û

Ûecho deleting new format files from working directoryÛ
Ûdel %1.logÛ
Ûdel %1.fmtÛ
