Some detailed comments on font substitution:
============================================

Normally there is no need for font substitution.  But when it is
needed the following information may be helpful.

Normal substitutions:
when a font file is not found, a substitute font name found in the font 
substitution table is used instead.  DVIPSONE has a default font substitution
table built-in that it resorts to if no substitution file is specified.

Forced substitutions (*force*):
a substitute font name found in the table is used if this flag appears
(whether or not the font file called for originally actually exists).

Remapped substitutions (*remap*):
an existing font file (or printer resident font) is used, but the
characters are remapped to TeX text positions (or other specified encoding).

Resident substitutions (*reside*):
a printer resident font is used (it may also have to be remapped).

Aliasing (*alias*):
the font name is assumed to be just an alias for the substitute font name
found in the table. The same metrics are assumed to apply.

Multiple magnifications:
when the same font is used at several different magnifications,
it only needs to be loaded once, of course.
