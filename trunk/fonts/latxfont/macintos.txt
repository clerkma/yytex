==========================================================================
LaTeX + SliTeX font set in fully hinted ATM compatible Adobe Type 1 format:
==========================================================================

This diskette contains:

	(*) Adobe Type 1 outline font files (PFB or PFA extension);
	(*) font metric files (AFM and TFM extension);
	(*) utility programs for IBM PC compatibles (EXE extension);

for:

	(*) the LaTeX line, circle, symbol fonts (5 design sizes),
	    and bold symbol font:

		line10, linew10,
		lcircle1, lcirclew,
		lasy5, lasy6, lasy7, lasy8, lasy9, lasy10, 
		lasyb10

	(*) the SliTeX lcmss* fonts:

		lcmss8, lcmssb8, lcmssi8

	(*) the SliTeX `invisible' fonts:

		ilcmss8, ilcmssb8, ilcmssi8
		icmtt8, icmmi8, icmmsy8, icmex10, ilasy8,

	(*) the logo fonts (used for the word METAFONT):

		logo8, logo9, logo10, 
		logobf10, logosl10

The IBM PC compatible versions of the fonts also include `Printer Font Metric'
(PFM) files for use with MS Windows.

The fonts are all fully hinted (both character-level and font-level), and so
will render well even on low-resolution (on screen) and medium-resolution
(laser printer) devices.  The fonts are completely compliant with the Type 1 
specification and, in addition, are ATM compatible (a tighter constraint).  
They also include work arounds for numerous bugs in `clone' interpreters.

The SliTeX fonts include the `invisible' fonts, although these will not 
often be used, since the they do not contain any actual character outlines.
To save space you may want to load only the 14 visible LaTeX + SliTeX fonts, 
and NOT load the 8 `invisible' fonts (names starting with `i').  
The same goes for the 5 `logo' fonts, which only contain the letters 
`M', `E', `T', `A', `F', `O', and `N'.

It may interest you to know that the LaTeX fonts and the LOGO fonts
were converted directly from the METAFONT source by Y&Y to ensure
perfect accuracy.  This was possible because the LaTeX fonts and LOGO
fonts use METAFONT in a rather restricted way.

Outline font file format:
-------------------------

The actual outline fonts themselves are supplied in  

	(*) Printer Font Binary (PFB) form; or 
	(*) Printer Font ASCII (PFA) form; or
	(*) Macintosh outline font format.

PFB files are typically used on IBM PC compatibles, and are what the
Windows PostScript driver and Adobe Type Manager (ATM) expect to see.
PFB file are compact, but need to be `unpacked' into the more verbose
hexadecimal PFA format before being sent to a printer.  The PostScript
printer driver does this.

On Unix and NeXT systems, it has been customary to use the PFA format, since
outline fonts in this form can be sent directly to the printer.  PFA files
can be included in a PostScript document that calls for a particular font.

Some applications (such as DVIPSONE) can handle fonts in either format.

For the NeXT version of the font set, see `nextfont.txt' for installation
instructions and use the script `nextinst.bat'.

Font Metric Files (AFM, TFM, PFM, and Mac screen font):
------------------------------------------------------

Adobe Type 1 outline fonts are normally supplied with human-readable 
metric files.  From these, compact binary application-specific metric files 
(such as TFM and PFM files) can be constructed.  

The IBM PC compatible versions of the fonts include `Printer Font Metric'
(PFM) files for use with Windows.  (These can also be constructed from the
AFM files using the utility AFMtoPFM that comes with DVIWindo).

The metric information on Macintosh computers resides in the `screen fonts'.

The TeX font metric files for these fonts are also included --- in the TFM
subdirectory --- but these are just from the standard TeX distribution and
most TeX users already have these.

Installation - Macintosh:
-------------------------

You need to install: (a) the outline font files and (b) the `screen fonts'.

*	We recommend Steve Brecher's Suitcase II (sold by Fifth Generation
*	Systems, Inc.).  Suitcase II greatly simplifies font installation
*	(and removal) and avoids problems arising from the fact that without
*	Suitcase II, font installation is different on System 6, System 7.0 -
*	and yet again on System 7.1! 

First install the outline font files themselves.  The outline fonts are 
the files with the Y&Y icon and a file name that has no extension.
Install the outline fonts as follows:

(1a) If you are using SuitCase II, create a new folder (`LaTeX SliTeX' say)
     and copy the outline fonts to this new folder.  The corresponding 
     screen fonts should be added to this folder later.

If you are not using SuitCase II:

(1b) For System 6, copy the outline font files themselves to your 
     system folder; 

(1c) For System 7.0, copy the outline font files to your CLOSED
     system folder. They will then be automatically installed 
     in the `Extensions' folder in your system folder; 

(1d) For System 7.1, copy the outline fonts files to your CLOSED
     system folder. They will then be automatically installed
     in the `Fonts' folder in the system folder.  

     Old versions of ATM  expect the fonts to be in the `Extensions' folder -
     so copy (or make aliases) for the fonts in the `Extensions' folder 
     (Older versions of the LaserWriter printer driver will also
     look for the fonts in the wrong place, by the way).

Next install the `screen fonts' (which is where the font metric
information is kept).  The screen fonts are files with a suitcase icon.
The screen fonts are kept in two files, "Visible Screen",
and "Invisible Screen".

Install the screen fonts as follows: 

(2a) if you are using Suitcase II, simply copy the screen fonts to the 
     folder created earlier for the outline fonts.  

If you are not using Suitcase II:

(2b) For System 6, launch Font D/A mover.  Then open the new screen font 
     suitcases and add each of the screen fonts (Screen fonts installed this
     way will be added to the System file in your System folder), or,  

(2c) For System 6 with Adobe's FontPorter installed, simply copy the
     screen font files to your System folder, or,

(2d) if you are using System 7, copy the screen font suitcases to your
     CLOSED system folder (they will be installed in your System file).

Now, if you are using Suitcase II, select Suitcase II from the `Apple menu',
create a new, named font set (`LaTeX SliTeX' say), and add the new screen
fonts to this set.  You can `open' the fonts at this point and they will
be available to applications (without needing to reboot the system).
You can also elect to have this set of fonts added to those that
will be opened automatically when the system is restarted in future.

If you are not using Suitcase II, then restart your system from the
`Special' menu.   Newly installed fonts will not be available to 
applications until you restart if you are not using Suitcase II.

For use with Textures, you may want to move the `LaTeX Metrics' file to the
`Fonts'  folder in the `Textures' folder.  This shouldn't normally be
neccessary, since Textures already knows the metrics of these fonts.

Enabling Fractional Widths - Macintosh:
---------------------------------------

If you are using these fonts with non-TeX applications then please
read the following.

*	IMPORTANT NOTE: Check that `Fractional Widths' are enabled.
*	This is required in order to get accurate character spacing.
*	Fortunately this is the default for most applications these days.

In MicroSoft Word, select `Page Setup' from the `File' menu, 
which will bring up the `LaserWriter PageSetup' dialog box. 
Check the `Fractional Width' box.

In Quark XPress, instead follow the trail `Edit', `Preferences',
`Typographic', then make sure `Fractional' is selected for
`Character Width' (as opposed to `Integral').

Aldus Pagemaker normally uses fractional widths.  If spacing nevertheless
seems irregular, then use the Apple LaserWriter printer driver, instead 
of the default Aldus printer driver.  To use the Apple LaserWriter 
printer driver, hold down the `Shift' and `Option' keys while selecting 
`File' from the main menu and then `Print...'

There are no actual bitmap fonts - Macintosh:
--------------------------------------------

The fonts are intended to be used with ATM --- there are no actual
bitmap screen fonts.  All on-screen rendering will by done by ATM.  
The `screen fonts' that are supplied do not contain recognizable glyphs.
They are there only to provide a substrate for the font metric information
(in the FOND resource), and to make it possible for ATM to find the actual
outline font file (One cannot use an outline font on the Macintosh
without some corresponding `screen font', since this is where the metric
information lives).

NOTE: Old versions of Key Caps uses the metric information from 
the actual bitmap `screen font' rather than from the FOND resource, 
so character spacing will be rather coarsely `quantized'.  
Other applications normally extract metric information from the 
FOND resource, which has accurate width and pair kerning data.

Remapping of character codes:
----------------------------

Since the character codes 0--31 and 127 cannot be generated from the keyboard
on the Macintosh, these characters have been remapped to the 161--196 range.
The range 0--9 can be accessed via codes 161--170, while 10--31 can be
accessed via 173--194, and 127 can be accessed via 196.

All of these codes can be generated by suitable key chords using the shift
and option keys.  Of course, you don't need to use these when the fonts are
used with TeX.

`Automatic' versus `Manual' downloading:
----------------------------------------

`Automatic' (i.e. temporary) downloading is normally the best approach 
in order to avoid filling up printer memory and to prevent print job
interdependence.  In this case the font is sent down to the printer
as part of the PostScript job being printed.  The font is removed from
printer memory at the end of the print job.

`Manual' (i.e. permanent) downloading can sometimes be useful when a printer
is used primarily with a fixed set of fonts (and these all fit into printer's
virtual memory).  Font downloaders can be used to permanently download
outline fonts.  A `manually' downloaded font remains resident until the
printer power is turned off (or the PostScript `quit' command is executed). 

The IBM PC utility DOWNLOAD supplied with the fonts can be used to download a
font `manually'.

Fonts can also be downloaded `manually' by sending them to the printer after
adding the line

	serverdict begin 0 exitserver

immediately following the last of the initial comment lines in the PFA file
(Comment lines start with a `%').  If you have PFB files, first convert them
to PFA format using the PFBtoPFA utility, insert the above line, then convert
back to PFB format using the PFAtoPFB utility. (In the above it has been
assumed that the printer's password is still the factory default, namely 0).

Sometimes `manual' downloading is used because the time to transmit a
PostScript file to the printer is an issue.  File transmission time can be
reduced by using a parallel instead of a serial printer connection.  Or, if a
serial line must be used, the baud rate can be increased.  Most printers can
handle 38,400 or 57,600 baud quite well (provided hand-shaking is set up
properly).  (The utility MODEX, supplied with DVIPSONE, can be used to
circumvent the DOS limit of 19,200 baud.  When using Windows 3.0, one can use
TurboComm from BioEngineering Research laboratory to go beyond the built-in
limit of 19,200 baud).

Also, applications that use `partial font downloading' (such as DVIPSONE)
produce PostScript files that are much shorter than those produced by
applications that simply unpack the PFB file into PFA format, making 
`automatic' downloading much more attractive.

PostScript `Clone' Interpreters Bugs:
----------------------------------

Most clone PostScript interpreters have some `misfeature' or other,
particularly when it comes to Type 1 font interpretation.  Such interpreters
may work prefectly well on plain vanilla Adobe text fonts, yet fail on more
complex fonts that fall perfectly well within in the Type 1 specification and
are even ATM compatible (a tighter constraint).

PostScript Interpreter Test Programs:
------------------------------------

In the PS subdirectory you will find nine PostScript test programs, and the
error handler (ehandler.ps).  These test files may come in useful should
there be a problem printing PostScript files using these fonts.  The test
programs check for various known bugs in `clone' interpreters, particularly 
as regards Type 1 font interpretation.  There is a short `readme.txt' file
in the same directory that describes the tests in more detail.
