Partial MSYM10 font file:
=========================

Enclosed find a PFB file for part of the AMS font msym10.

This is the font now called msbm10 (with some changes).

NOTE: the PFB file ONLY contains the characters: C, N, R, S, and Z
(which are the black-board bold characters most often called for).

There are also font metric files: TFM, PFM, and AFM.

The outlines were eye-balled from 900 dpi bitmaps.  The outlines are
not accurate, although they look fine when printed at `normal' size.
The stem width may be 5% to 10% too light.

These outlines are not up to the standard of fonts traced from very
high resolution bitmaps, or those made directly from MetaFont programs
(such as Y&Y's LaTeX and Logo fonts).

But they work better than enlarged bitmap fonts anyway...

The font is fully hinted and will work well even on low resolution devices.

	(If you need more characters from the blackboard bold font, please 
	note that the blackboard bold character set may also be found in 
	Adobe's Mathematical Pi 6 font and in Bigelow & Holmes 
	LucidaBrightMathArrows)

SANS SERIF BLACKBOARD BOLD --- A Partial MSYM10 font
====================================================

There was some discussion on comp.text.tex regarding the relative virtues of
the `old' AMS Blackboard Bold (MSYM*) versus the `new' AMS Blackboard Bold
(MSBM*).  Some people seem to prefer the old version.  Unfortunately it
appears that the old version was written in an old version of METAFONT, and 
so is hard to use today to generate PK bitmap font files.

This brought to mind a ATM compatible Type 1 font that was made up as a
stop-gap measure long before the AMS font set became available in Type 1
format.  This was a partial font containing just the most commonly used
letters from MSYM10, namely C, N, R, S, Z (for complex numbers, integers,
reals etc).  

Attached find PFA, AFM, PFB, PFM, and TFM files.  On Unix/NeXT you'd most
probably want to use the PFA and AFM files, and on IBM PC compatibles (and
for ATM in Windows), the PFB and PFM files.  These files are included here
without warranties of any kind.  Use them if you know how.  Please don't ask
how to use them with _your_ favourite printer driver or previewer - we
almost certainly do _not_ know the answer!

WARNING: this is only a partial font containing the letters C, N, R, S, Z
