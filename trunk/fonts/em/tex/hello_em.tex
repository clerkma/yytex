% NOTE: make sure you have `Font > Encoding' in DVIWindo set to TeX 'n ANSI

% EM fonts are based on CM, but include ready-made accented characters.
% This makes it possible to set up TeX to hyphenate words that contain
% accented characters.

% Unlike CM, EM is not restricted to fixed text font encoding layout.
% You can EM it with any encoding you like, although most people
% use it with TeX 'n ANSI (LY1) encoding or Cork (T1) encoding.

% NOTE: if you want to use Cork/T1 encoding use \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% You may find LY1 more useful than T1 since it provides access to about
% 38 more useful glyphs, obviating the need for `text companion' fonts.

% You can use standard hyphenation tables set up for T1 also with LY1
% since the alphabetic characters, accented characters and special
% characters are in the same place.
