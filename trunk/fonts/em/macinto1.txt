=====================================================================
European Modern font set for the Macintosh --- Installation:
=====================================================================

These diskettes contain:

	(*) Adobe Type 1 outline font files (diskettes A, B, C);
	(*) screen fonts (diskettes A and C);
	(*) font metric files - AFM and TFM extension (diskettes D and E);
	(*) plain TeX, LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX 2e support (diskette C).

for:

	(*) European Modern text font
	(*) European Modern math fonts
	(*) Some Computer Modern math fonts

The fonts are in Adobe Type 1 format (a.k.a. `PostScript' or `ATM' fonts).
For on screen viewing you will need Adobe Type Manager (ATM).
We recommend the new ATM Deluxe 4.0 since it adds font management
capabilities to its basic font rasterizing function.  With older 
versions of ATM you may want to use SuitCase II for font management.

Outline font file format:
-------------------------

The actual outline fonts themselves are supplied in Macintosh outline font
format.  These files appear with the YandY icon and have no extension on the
file name.

Font Metric Files (AFM, TFM, and Mac screen font):
--------------------------------------------------

Adobe Type 1 outline fonts are normally supplied with human-readable 
metric files (AFM).  From these, compact binary application-specific metric
files (such as TFM files) can be constructed.  

The metric information on Macintosh computers resides in the `screen fonts'.
Screen fonts appear with a `suitcase' icon.

The TeX font metric files for these fonts are also included --- in the TFM
subdirectory.  Textures uses a compact `Textures Metric' file instead.

Text font TFM files are encoding sensitive.  We provided TFM files
for the most commonly used encodings: T1(Cork), LY1(TeX 'n ANSI), 
as well as LM1(Textures) and  Macintosh standard roman encoding.

Installation - Macintosh:
-------------------------

You need to install: (a) the outline font files and (b) the `screen fonts'.

*	We recommend ATM `Deluxe' 4.0 as a font installer/font manager;

*	Also useful is Steve Brecher's Suitcase II (sold by Fifth Generation
*	Systems, Inc.).  Suitcase II greatly simplifies font installation
*	(and removal) and avoids problems arising from the fact that 
*	font installation is different for various versions of the Systems.

First install the outline font files themselves.  The outline fonts are 
the files with the YandY icon and a file name that has no extension.
Install the outline fonts as follows:

(1a) If you are using ATM Deluxe 4.0 follow the installation instructions
     
(1b) If you are using SuitCase II, create a new folder (`European Modern' 
     say) and copy the outline fonts to this new folder.  The 
     corresponding screen fonts should be added to this folder later.

If you are not using ATM Deluxe 4.0 or SuitCase II:

(1c) For System 6, copy the outline font files themselves to your 
     system folder; 

(1d) For System 7.0, copy the outline font files to your CLOSED
     system folder. They will then be automatically installed 
     in the `Extensions' folder in your system folder; 

(1e) For System 7.1, copy the outline fonts files to your CLOSED
     system folder. They will then be automatically installed
     in the `Fonts' folder in the system folder.  

     Very old versions of ATM  expect the fonts to be in the `Extensions'
	 folder - so copy (or make aliases) for the fonts in the `Extensions' 
     folder (Very old versions of the LaserWriter printer driver will also
     look for the fonts in the wrong place, by the way).

Next install the `screen fonts' (which is where the font metric
information is kept).  The screen fonts are files with a suitcase icon.

Install the screen fonts as follows: 

(2a) If you are using ATM Deluxe 4.0 follow the instructions. 

(2b) if you are using Suitcase II, simply copy the screen fonts to the 
     folder created earlier for the outline fonts.  

If you are not using ATM Deluxe 4.0 or Suitcase II:

(2c) For System 6, launch Font D/A mover.  Then open the new screen font 
     suitcases and add each of the screen fonts (Screen fonts installed this
     way will be added to the System file in your System folder), or,  

(2d) For System 6 with Adobe's FontPorter installed, simply copy the
     screen font files to your System folder, or,

(2e) if you are using System 7, copy the screen font suitcases to your
     CLOSED system folder (they will be installed in your System file).

Now, if you are using Suitcase II, select Suitcase II from the `Apple menu',
create a new, named font set (`European Modern' say), and add the new screen
fonts to this set.  You can `open' the fonts at this point and they will
be available to applications (without needing to reboot the system).
You can also elect to have this set of fonts added to those that
will be opened automatically when the system is restarted in future.

If you are not using ATM Deluxe 4.0 or Suitcase II, then restart your 
system from the `Special' menu.  Newly installed fonts will not be 
available to applications until you restart in this case.

For use with Textures, move the `EM Text Metrics' and `EM Math Metrics'
files to the  `TeX Fonts' folder in the `Textures' folder.  

For use with Textures move the required source files to the ``TeX Inputs'
folder.  For LaTeX 2e, you will need the `LaTeX 2e'' folder for example.
See below.

Enabling Fractional Widths - Macintosh:
---------------------------------------

If you are using these fonts with non-TeX applications then please
read the following.

*	IMPORTANT NOTE: Check that `Fractional Widths' are enabled.
*	This is required in order to get accurate character spacing.
*	Fortunately this is the default for most applications these days.

In MicroSoft Word, select `Page Setup' from the `File' menu, 
which will bring up the `LaserWriter PageSetup' dialog box. 
Check the `Fractional Width' box.

In Quark XPress, instead follow the trail `Edit', `Preferences',
`Typographic', then make sure `Fractional' is selected for
`Character Width' (as opposed to `Integral').

Aldus Pagemaker normally uses fractional widths.  If spacing nevertheless
seems irregular, then use the Apple LaserWriter printer driver, instead 
of the default Aldus printer driver.  To use the Apple LaserWriter 
printer driver, hold down the `Shift' and `Option' keys while selecting 
`File' from the main menu and then `Print...'

There are no actual bitmap fonts - Macintosh:
--------------------------------------------

The fonts are intended to be used with ATM --- there are no actual
bitmap screen fonts.  All on-screen rendering will by done by ATM.  
The `screen fonts' that are supplied do not contain recognizable glyphs.
They are there only to provide a substrate for the font metric information
(in the FOND resource), and to make it possible for ATM to find the actual
outline font file (One cannot use an outline font on the Macintosh
without some corresponding `screen font', since this is where the metric
information lives).

NOTE: Very old versions of Key Caps uses the metric information from 
the actual bitmap `screen font' rather than from the FOND resource, 
so character spacing will be rather coarsely `quantized'.  
Other applications normally extract metric information from the 
FOND resource, which has accurate width and pair kerning data.

Remapping of character codes:
----------------------------

The CM math fonts and the EM math fonts use character code 0 - 31 and 127.
Since the character codes 0--31 and 127 cannot be generated from the keyboard
on the Macintosh, these characters have been remapped to the 161--196 range.
The range 0--9 can be accessed via codes 161--170, while 10--31 can be
accessed via 173--194, and 127 can be accessed via 196.  

All of these codes can be generated by suitable key chords using the shift
and option keys.  Of course, you don't need to use these when the fonts are
used with TeX.  Also, the remapping is not used with the EM test fonts since
these are ordinary Type 1 text fonts.

Virtual Fonts:
--------------

No virtual fonts are needed for European Modern fonts.  Each text font
only requires a single TFM file complete with ligature and kerning
information.  This applies whether you are using T1 (Cork), LY1
(TeX 'n ANSI) encoding or LM1 (Textures) encoding.

Textures installation:
--------------------

Drag the `EM Text Metrics' and  `EM Math Metrics'  (diskette E) to your
Textures `TeX Fonts' folder.  There is no need for `CM Math Metrics' since 
Textures already knows those.

Drag the TeX support folders (diskette C) to your Textures `TeX Inputs' folder.  
For plain TeX support, drag the `Plain TeX' folder.
For LaTeX 2.09 support, drag the `LaTeX 2.09' folder.
For LaTeX 2e suport, drag the `LaTeX 2e' folder.

Use with other TeX implementations:
-----------------------------------

TFM files for use with OzTeX and other TeX implementationsd may be found on
diskette E.  Also refer to the folder `OzTeX' for additional information
(diskette C).

For DVIPS look in the `psfonts' folder (diskette C).

Support for various font encoding schemes:
---------------------------------------

EM text fonts have 310 glyphs that cover T1 (Cork), LY1 (TeX 'n ANSI),
LM1(Textures), Windows ANSI, and Macintosh standard roman encoding. 
T1 font encoding support comes with LaTeX 2e.  LY1 font encoding
support may be found in the LY1 folder on diskette C (or on CTAN in
tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/psnfssx/ly1).
Support for LM1 may be found on diskette C.

If you are using DVIPS, then do not use TeX Base 1 (8r) as a base encoding 
since it does not contain all of the glyphs needed.  Use T1 or LY1 encoding
directly (that is, refer to tex256.enc or texnansi.enc in psfonts.map).
