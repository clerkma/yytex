cmr10.two & cmr17.two are in a form that seems most suitable for
	distribution of the fonts for PC compatibles and other computers.

cmr10.mac & cmr17.mac are in a form that seems most suitable for building
	the MacIntosh POST resources version of the font files.

NOTE: cmr10 has full character and font level hinting, cmr17 has none.
