Setting up your own custom encoding for text fonts (customen.txt)
==================================================================

Y&Y TeX System is the only TeX system providing full flexibility in font
encoding.  It has ready made support files for several common encoding
schemes as shown in `Fonts > Encoding'.  If none of these happen to suit
your needs, you can set up your own custom encoding. Here is how:

(1) Pick one of the .vec files supplied in c:\yandy\fonts\encoding,
    or create a new one modelled on one of these sample files.
    Let's say, e.g., that you want to use texmac.vec (Textures encoding).

(2) Add a new environment variable called CUSTOM to the [Environment]
    section of dviwindo.ini.  Set it to the name of the new vector, e.g.
	
	CUSTOM=texmac

    You should now see a new item listed in `Fonts > Encoding'.  
    It should read `CUSTOM texmac' --- but it will be greyed out
	until you tell the system where the corresponding TFM files live.

(3) Set up a new `encoding specific' version of TEXFONTS.  For example,

	TEXMAC=C:\YANDY\FONTS\TFM\CUSTOM\TFM;C:\YANDY\FONTS\TFM\NONTEXT\;
			C:\YANDY\FONTS\TFM\CUSTOM\  (all on one line of course)

    This refers to directories for new TFM files for this encoding.
    This addition will enable the above `Fonts > Encoding' menu item.

    You will now be able to view font layout using `Fonts > ShowFont'
	And you will be able to view DVI files created using that encoding.

(4) If you also want to create new DVI files with this encoding, then 
    you will need TFM files for TeX to use.  Create TFM files for the 
    fonts you want to use from DVIWindo's `WriteTFM...' menu selection.  
    These will automatically be set up for the currently selected 
    encoding and placed in the first directpory listed in the 
	environment variable set up in step (3) above.

    You will also need to tell TeX about the layout since it otherwise
	assumes the default OT1 (TeX text) encoding.  In plain TeX and
    LaTeX 2.09, look at lcdplain.tex and mtplain.tex for sample files.
    In LaTeX 2e, look at the PSNFSS package --- the `times', `mathtimes'
	and `lucidabr' packages in particular.
