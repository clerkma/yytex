Using CM outline fonts with Windows 3.0 applications
----------------------------------------------------

These versions of the CM Type 1 outline fonts have been massaged to
work around various bugs in ATM for the PC.  To use them:

 (1) First Install ATM (if you have not already done so):
     Insert ATM diskette in drive A
     Launch Windows 3.0
     In `Program Manager' menu, select `run'
     Type in `a:install'
     Follow installation instructions
 (2) Exit from Windows 3.0 (changes to ATM only become effective upon restart)
 (3) You may have to install the fonts that came with ATM (if not done above):
     Launch Windows 3.0
     Double click on ATM icon (large red lower case `a')
     Click on `Add'
     select drive/directory [-a-] and then select directory `psfonts'
     select all 11 fonts (drag down from first while pushing mouse button).
     Click on `Add'

 (4) To install desired CM fonts, restart Windows 
     Double click on ATM icon
     Click on `Add'
     Place one of the two diskettes with CM .pfb & .pfm files in drive A:
     Select drive/directpry [-a-] in file menu
     Pick the fonts you wish to install (use control click to get several).
     Click on `Add'
     Exit from Windows 3.0 (changes to ATM only become effective upon restart)

(ATM copies the selected .pfb files to c:\psfonts and the corresponding .pfm
files to c:\psfonts\pfm, and adds appropriate softfont entries to win.ini).

The fonts you have added will now show up in application's font
selection menus. (In some applications you may need to invoke
`printer setup' to alert the application to the existence of new fonts)
ATM will provide screen rendering of these fonts - no screen fonts needed.

Now for printing with these fonts:

`Manual' versus `Automatic' downloading.
---------------------------------------

You can either `manually' download the fonts to the printer - making
them resident in the printer's virtual memory until it is rebooted -
or have them downloaded `automatically' with the file to be printed.
If you only do what was listed above, then Windows applications will
assume you have `manually' downloaded the fonts to the printer.

I think there are only a few situations in which `manual', permanent
downloading makes sense - although MicroSoft says the opposite,
recommending `manual' downloading - this may be because `automatic'
downloading does not work properly yet in Windows 3.0.  Fortunately
these bugs too can be worked around as shown below.

`Manual' downloading:  

Copy the file `download.exe' (from the (A) disk with .PFB & .PFM
files) to some hard disk location on your path.  Type `download -?'
to see what arguments `download' takes.  Then use it to load font
files (in .pfb) form to the printer's virtual memory (VM).  Normally
you would just type

	download -p <pfb-file-1> <pfb-file-2> ...
	
The downloaded fonts act just like ordinary printer resident fonts
until the printer is rebooted.

`Automatic' downloading: 

Due to a bug in the Windows PostScript printer driver, binary font
files (.pfb) are not expanded into the ASCII form (.pfa) required by the
printer.  But you can use .pfa files directly (although this is a nuisance,
since these are twice as large as .pfb files, and also redundant
since you already have the corresponding .pfb files).  First,
copy the desired .pfa files from the diskettes containing the .pfa
files to some (arbitrary) directory on hard disk. 

All that is needed in addition is that you modify the `softfont'
entries in win.in that were created by ATM for the new fonts you have
installed.  Add a comma to the end of each line, followed by the
pathname of the .pfa file - after the pathname for the .pfm file.

For example, change this:

softfont37=c:\psfonts\pfm\cmbx10.pfm
softfont38=c:\psfonts\pfm\cmr10.pfm
softfont39=c:\psfonts\pfm\cmti10.pfm

to that

softfont37=c:\psfonts\pfm\cmbx10.pfm,c:\cmbkph\cmbx10.pfa
softfont38=c:\psfonts\pfm\cmr10.pfm,c:\cmbkph\cmr10.pfa
softfont39=c:\psfonts\pfm\cmti10.pfm,c:\cmbkph\cmti10.pfa

Note that this is different from what the Windows manual says.
Note also that there should be no space anywhere in the line.
Note further that the `softfonts' may appear in several places in the
win.ini file (since you may have several `printers' installed).
Make the above changes in all places.
See `win.ini' sample file (on diskette (A) with .pfb and .pfm files).

Now Windows applications will use the .pfm files for font metric
information, ATM will use the .pfb files for font rendering on
screen, and the PostScript printer driver will package the .pfa files
with the output going to the printer (or file).

If everything prints in Courier font instead of CM, then you have
neither manually nor automatically downloaded the fonts.  Possibly
there is then some error in the win.ini file

Hopefully one day MicroSoft will fix the PostScript driver so it unpacks
.pfb files into .pfa files...

Interaction with DVIPSONE:
-------------------------

If you are using DVIPSONE, you probably already have the CM Type 1
fonts installed in some directory other than c:\psfonts, like perhaps
c:\cm.  ATM wants the .pfb files to live in c:\psfonts.

To avoid duplication, place all of the .pfb files into c:\psfonts.
If you have a recent version of DVIPSONE, it's built in searchpath
for font files is already `c:\cm;c:\psfonts'.  If not, use a command
line argument to tell it where the fonts are, or set the environmnet
variable PSFONTS to the appropriate directory.

(If you have a recent version of DVIPSONE, the command line argument
and the environment variable can be searchpaths rather than just a single
pathnames).
