============================================================================
	Long File Name mini-upgrade of Y&Y TeX System for Windows 95:
============================================================================

The executables on this diskette are designed to work in 32 bit operating
systems (Windows 95 and Windows NT), and all support long file names.
They will not work in 16 bit operating systems line Windows 3.1.

DVIPSONE:
=========

  dvipsone.exe     248,832   4-03-96   9:19p
  dvipream.enc      16,311   2-25-96   3:27p

DVIPSONE.EXE on this diskette is the new 32 bit version of DVIPSONE.  
It handles long files names, and is about 32% faster.  Note:

*	Make sure to copy DVIPREAM.ENC also to your DVIPSONE directory, 
	because DVIPSONE checks the version number in the preamble file.

Y&Y TeX:
========

  yandytex.exe      311,808  2-16-96   6:44a

YANDYTEX.EXE on this diskette is TeX 3.141 --- without PharLap DOS extender.

This version of Y&Y TeX handles tilde (~) in file names on the command line
--- despite the fact that TeX parses the command line and treats ~ special.
This is important because in Windows 95 you may encounter both the actual
long file names *and* their shortened DOS equivalents --- which contain
tilde characters.  

Note, however that TeX cannot handle file names that contain spaces 
(since it does not know where the names ends on the command line).


DVIWindo:
=========

  dviwindo.exe     301,952   4-06-96  10:04a

DVIWINDO.EXE is the new version of DVIWindo which can handle long file names.
This is still a WIN16 program.

To actually see the long file names in DVIWindo's file open dialog box
(rather than their shortened DOS equivalents) add LongNames=1 to the 
[Window] section of dviwindo.ini (in your Windows directory):

[Window]
LongNames=1

For fun, add a [Document] section to the dviwindo.ini file (if you 
do not already have one) and add one arbitrary DVI file name, e.g.

[Documents]
File1=c:\dviwindo\dvi_help.dvi
