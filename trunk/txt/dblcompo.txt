EXAMPLE: Making doubly accented characters:
-------------------------------------------

Make PFA file from PFB, e.g.

	pfbtopfa -v tir

Modify names and Unique ID in PFA file to avoid confusion, e.g.

	change file name to tirx____.pfa
	change FontName to TimesX-Roman
	change FullName to TimesX Roman
	change FamilyName to TimesX
	comment out UniqueID

Reencode to final encoding (could also do later)

	reencode -vx -c=myencode tirx

Insert first set of new composites

	composit -v -c=first.cmp tirx

Expand SEAC calls for new composites.  May need -f if font not reencoded yet.

	safeseac -v -f tirx

Insert second set of composites.  Note use of -S flag to allow non ASE base.

	composit -v -S -c=second.cmp tirx

Expand SEAC calls for new composites.
Note use of -S flag to allow non ASE base.
Also use of -f to force processing despite comment in file.

	safeseac -v -f tirx

Extract AFM file:

	pfatoafm -v tirx
or
	pfatoafm -v -a=tir_____.afm tirx

Convert to PFB format:

	pfatopfb -v tirx

Make corresponding PFM file:

	afmtopfm -vsd tirx

Critical part is use of -S with COMPOSIT and SAFESEAC in second
step, since base characters are used that are *not* in ASE
(i.e. they are already accented characters made in first round).

Also, must reencode *before* second application of COMPOSIT
since otherwise the base characters of the second round composites
are not in the encoding, and COMPOSIT will not know what number
to use to refer to them.

Also, must reencode font ahead of time or use -f to force SAFESEAC
to work in the first round.  

May need to use -f with SAFESEAC in second round, because
the SAFESEAC comment is now in the font file (unless COMPOSIT
removed it again)
