Alternate installation of ATM and fonts in Windows 95/98
========================================================

In some situations in Windows 95/98, installation of ATM with fonts
ends without fanfare and without asking to relaunch Windows.  In this
case ATM is *not* properly installed, and the fonts that came with it
will not be available.

You can easily check whether ATM is properly installed, since if it
is, you can launch the ATM control panel from `Start > Programs >
Adobe > ATM.'  When the installation fails you typically won't have
an `Adobe' folder under `Programs'.

The solution in this situation is simple:

(1) Install ATM *without* fonts, then 
(2) install the fonts from the ATM control panel.

To do this, right click on the CD icon in "My Computer".
Then select "Install ATM for Windows 95/98 without fonts"
from the menu that pops up.  When it is done, it should
ask you to reboot.  

When Windows starts up again, start the ATM control panel from `Start
> Programs > Adobe > ATM' (You will be asked to customize the ATM
control panel the first time you use it).  Then select `Browse for
Fonts' on the right hand side of the control panel and navigate to
the CD.  Find the `psfonts' folder on the CD and open it.  Wait for
ATM to find and list all the fonts.  Then select them all and install.
