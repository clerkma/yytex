    Linking from DVIWindo back to the editor     (file: editlink.txt)
=========================================================================

Editors that provide DDE support (such as WinEDT, PFE, UltraEdit and Epsilon)
can be controlled using an `inverse search' mechanism from the DVIWindo
preview back to the TeX source file.  Once set up, you can double click on 
text in the preview and have the editor show the corresponding source file 
with the cursor positioned appropriately.

(1) For LaTeX 2e, add \usepackage[active]{srcltx}.
    For plain TeX, add \input srctex.sty instead.

(2) Add a suitable definition for the environment variable `EditorDDE' 
    (see list below).  You can do this from DVIWindo using 
    `Preferences > Environment' (or by editing dviwindo.ini).

(3) Make sure that the environment variable TEXEDIT is set up correctly
    (see list below) --- this is needed to launch the editor in the 
    situation where it is *not* already running.

The `EditorDDE' line contains a set of semicolon separated items.  The first
two are the DDE `Application' and `Topic.' These are followed by one or more
command strings for the DDE server (All but the last are executed
synchronously. The last (or only) command string is executed asynchronously).

In these strings, %s is replaced with the source file name and %d is replaced
with the line number (Similarly, %l and %a are replaced by the log file name
and the auxiliary file name).  Since `;' is a string separator in this
context, you need to use `%;' to get a semicolon.

*	Installation of Y&Y TeX System sets up EditorDDE and TEXEDIT for WinEdt.

Examples:

(1) WinEDT (Aleksander Simonic) http://www.winedt.com

EditorDDE=WinEdt;DDEServer;[Open('%s')%;SelLine(%d,8);SetFocus('')]
TEXEDIT="c:\Program Files\WinEdt\WinEdt.exe" [Open('%s');SelLine(%d,8)] 

(2) PFE32 (Alan Philips)        http://www.lancs.ac.uk/people/cpaap/pfe/

EditorDDE=PFE32;Editor;[FileOpen(%s)];[EditGotoLine(%d,0)];[ComeToForeground()]
TEXEDIT=c:\yandy\pfe\pfe32.exe /g %d %s

(3) UltraEdit (IDM)             http://www.idmcomp.com/

EditorDDE=UltraEdit;System;[open("%s"/%d)]
TEXEDIT="c:\Program Files\ultraedt\uedit32.exe" %s/%d

(4) Epsilon (Lugaru)            http://www.lugaru.com/

EditorDDE=Epsilon;Open;+%d %s
TEXEDIT="c:\Program Files\eps90\bin\e32.exe" +%d %s


NOTES:
======

You must use the srcltx.sty or srctex.sty files to place the markers
needed in the DVI file.  Otherwise nothing happens when you double click.

If you \input subsiduary files in your main TeX file you need to
use a modified version of \input (namely \Input) so that the actual
source file name is recorded in the DVI file.  When doing this,
use the full name of the file with extension (e.g. .tex).
See srcltx.sty or srctex.tex for additional details if needed.

You must click on text.  Clicking on a blank area (or a rule) will not work. 

Since TeX processes input a paragraph at a time, and since it is not
safe to insert \special{...} in just any old place, the editor's
cursor may, in some cases be positioned a few lines before or after 
the expected place in the source file.

The editor has to know the directory in which the source file resides.
If you are *not* using a common Working Directory, then this will be
the same place as the DVI file.  DVIWindo can then supply a full path
to the editor for opening the file.  When using a common Working
Directory, you may need to set the editor's default path to be where
the TeX source files are located.

Do not double click on headers or footers.  Since these are processed
`asynchronously' there is no place in the source file that corresponds
to them.  Since headers and footers are processed and output by TeX 
when it has started to read material for the next page, the position
indicated in the source may be somewhere on the following page.

DVIWindo also supports `forward search' by setting up a DDE server
that the editor can communicate with.  WinEdt can take advantage of 
this.
