To convert a Type 1 font from Mac to IBM PC:
============================================

Transport the actual outline font file and the screen font file
to the IBM PC in MacBinary form.  If there is more than one
font in the screen font suitcase, first separate them and send
only the one you need (it works otherwise, but is confusing).

You can use Apple MacIntosh Exchange to write to an IBM formatted
diskette.  The parts of the files you want are in the `resource'
directory.  Or send as BinHex attachment in email or use FTP.

Then use MACtoPFA on the actual outline font.  This will work on 
either a font file in MacBinary form, or on a file containing
just the resource fork.

If you need the font file in PFB format, use PFAtoPFB on the PFA file.

If you have actual AFM files use these.  

If you do not have AFM files you can reconstruct most of the 
information using SCRtoAFM on the screen font suitcase.

For use in Windows, run AFMtoPFM next to create the PFM file.

For use with TeX run AFMtoTFM on the AFM file.  Unlike other methods,
this will create a single TFM file complete with ligatures and
kerning (no need for virtual fonts).

If for some reason you need to hard-reencode the font itself or 
the AFM file, then use REENCODE.  

You can get a command line summary in most cases by using -?
on the command line e.g. afmtotfm -?

Note that you want to use different command line flags with 
AFMtoPFM and AFMtoTFM when the font is a `pi/math/symbol/decorative'
fonts as opposed to a plain vanilla text font.

See manual for additional details.  See also *.txt files, e.g. macandpc.txt
