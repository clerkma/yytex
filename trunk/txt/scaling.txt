Note on scaling of the Computer Modern outline fonts:
----------------------------------------------------

These font metric files are based in the information produced by
MetaFont and hence are in dimensionless units, as they should be.
When a font is to be used at a particular point size, it has to be
scaled appropriately, as usual.  

A potential problem arises because TeX, and most software working
with DVI files produced by TeX, assumes that a point is a "printer's
unit", that is, 1/72.27 of an inch, while PostScript assumes that a
point is a "big point", that is 1/72 of an inch.

As a result, if one wishes to obtain output using outline fonts that
is EXACTLY the same size as output produced using bitmap versions of
the CM fonts, one needs to be sure to specify the correct point size.
Thus, for example, one should use something like

	/cmr10 findfont 10 72 mul 72.27 div scalefont setfont

to obtain a true 10 point (printer's units) outline font. (Check
first, however, that your DVI-to-PS converter isn't already rescaling).

In any case, the effect of rescaling on the character outlines
themselves will be quite negligible, the ONLY noticable effect being
on character widths, and hence line lengths.

The difference is only 0.375 % and so not noticable in most cases.
It can in fact be totally ignored when a DVI-to-PS converter is used
that uses absolute positioning commands within a line rather than
relative moves (such as Nelson Beebe's DVIALW converter).

(The alternative of scaling all of the font metric information by
multiplying by 72/72.27 was thought to be too  ad hoc  to be
considered seriously).
