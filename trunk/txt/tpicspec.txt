Some Notes on TPIC \specials:
============================

TPIC \specials are used by various TeX macro packages (such as `curvesls.sty'
and `eepic.sty') to draw simple shapes in a device independent way.  
TPIC is the low level language used by these higher-level TeX macro packages.
Several DVI processors now support TPIC \specials, including DVIPSONE,
DVIWindo and DVIPS. 

One use of TPIC specials depends on accumulating a polygonal path,
and then `stroking' this path using solid, dashed or dotted lines
or even quadratic splines; and/or `filling' the shape obtained by 
closing the polygonal path.

It is also possible to draw circles, ciruclar disks, ellipses aligned
with the coordinate axes and elliptical arcs.

TPIC commands are two-letter words followed in some cases by numeric
arguments. The command words are meant to be mnemonic (but are mostly
mnemonic only in a somewhat misleading way).

Here follow some notes on TPIC \specials:
-----------------------------------------

(*)	The origin of the coordinate system is at TeX's current point ---
	x increasing to the right and y increasing downward.

(*)	TeX's current point is NOT disturbed by TPIC \specials
	(so this is NOT a way to displace text typeset in TeX).

(*)	Lengths, widths and coordinates are in milli-inches (0.001")
	Only integers are permitted.  An exception is the specification
	of dash length and dot interval, which is in inches.

(*)	Angles are in radians, clockwise (!) from the horizontal.
	(Angles are allowed to be reals, of course).

(*)	Grey-levels lie between 0.0 and 1.0 --- 0 being white, 1 black.
	(Note that this is reversed from common usage).

(*)	`stroke' here means draw a solid, dashed, or dotted line, or a 
	spline with a pen of specified width. Strokes are always black.

(*)	`fill' here means to fill a closed shape with a specified grey level.
	If no grey-level is explicitely specified, then black is assumed.
	The shape will be implicitly closed if it is not closed already.

(*)	Stroking and/or filling a polygonal path resets it.
	The next path-accumulating command starts a new path.

(*)	Explicitly setting the grey level implies that the next shape is to
	be filled. The request to fill a shape is reset after it is filled.
	To fill the next shape, the grey-level must be specified again.

(*)	Some implementations have limits on how many lines a polygonal path
	may consist of (600 typically).

(*)	Unfortunately, there are some ambiguities in the definitions.
	Different implementations will do different things in some cases.
	Often implementation choices reflect what is easy to do	in a 
	particular graphics model. See notes near the end.

Here are the TPIC \special commands:
------------------------------------

pn <n>		set pen width for stroking to <n> (milli-inches).

bk		flag next graphic to be filled, and 
		set grey-level for fill to 1 (black).

wh		flag next graphic to be filled, and 
		set grey-level for fill to 0 (white).

sh [<g>]	flag next graphic to be filled, and 
		set grey-level for fill to <g>, if optional argument is given;
		otherwise set grey-level to the default which is 0.5 (grey).

tx <hex>	use specified bit-pattern for filling. 
		This is	typically translated to an equivalent grey level.

pa <x> <y>	Add the point <x> <y> to the current path. That is,
		move to <x> <y>, if this is the first point in new path, 
		otherwise add a line to <x> <y> to the path being accumulated.

fp		stroke solid polygonal line defined using sequence of `pa's.
		If shading was requested using `bk', `gr' or `wh',
		then also fill the shape defined by closing the figure.

ip		fill polygonal shape that was defined by sequence of `pa's.
		Use the grey level specified by `bk', `gr' or `wh'.
		The shape is closed first if necessary.

da <l>		stroke dashed polygonal line defined using sequence of `pa's.
		<l> is the length of dashes, and the inter-dash interval
		(specified in inches).
		The length of the dash is adjusted so that each line starts
		and ends with a full length dash.
		If shading was requested using `bk', `gr' or `wh',
		then also fill the shape defined by closing the figure.

dt <l>		stroke dotted polygonal line defined using sequence of `pa's.
		<l> is the interval between dots (specified in inches).
		The interval between dots is adjusted so that each line
		starts and ends with a dot.
		If shading was requested using `bk', `gr' or `wh',
		then also fill the shape defined by closing the figure.

sp [<l>]	stroke a quadratic spline through the midpoints of the lines
		defined using a sequence of `pa's. The spline starts
		with a straight line from the first point to the mid-point
		of the first line.  The spline ends with a straight line
		from the mid-point of the last line to the last point.

		If the optional <l> is omitted (or zero) then the spline 
		is stroked solid.
		If <l> is positive, then it gives the length of the dashes
		and the interval between dashes to be used (in inches).
		If <l> is negative, then its magnitude indicates the
		interval between dots to be used (in inches).

ar <xo> <yo> <xr> <yr> <sa> <ea>

		Stroke an elliptical arc.  The center of the ellipse is
		at <xo> <yo>.  The major and minor axes are aligned with
		the coordinate system axes.  The horizontal and vertical
		semi-axes have lengths <xr> and <yr> respectively. 
		The arc goes clockwise from the starting angle <sa> to
		the ending angle <ea>. 
		If shading is requested using `bk', `gr' or `wh',
		then also fill the shape defined by closing the figure.

ia <xo> <yo> <xr> <yr> <sa> <ea>

		Fill an elliptical arc after closing the figure.
		Use the grey level specified by `bk', `gr' or `wh'.
		The center of the ellipse is at <xo> <yo>.  
		The major and minor axes are aligned with the coordinate 
		system axes.  The horizontal and vertical
		semi-axes have lengths <xr> and <yr> respectively. 
		The arc goes clockwise from the starting angle <sa> to
		the ending angle <ea>. 

Note that TPIC state information, such as pen width and grey level cannot
be carried across page boundaries, or page independence will be lost.

There are several ambiguities in the interpretation of TPIC \specials.
Avoid the grey areas if maximum portability is a concern.
To be safe, always specify the pen-width using `pn' before starting to put
together a new polygonal path or drawing an elliptical arc.
To be safe, always explicitly set the grey level if filling is desired 
using `bk', `wh', or `sh'.

Ambiguities:
------------

	How should an elliptical arc be `filled' when the difference
	in angles is not 2 pi?
	It could be either as a chord, or as a pie slice.
	The former being easier to implement, the latter more useful.

	What is the width of the pen when it is not explicitly specified?
	Does it remain at the last used value or is it reset to some default?
	
	How should the `line join' and `line cap' be set?
	Some implementations set `line cap' to `round' and 
	leave `line join' set to `mitered'. 
	Some graphics models do not provide a choice, and force use of
	`round' for both.

	Should the lengths of dashes be reduced to account for the round ends?

	Should dots in a dotted curve be circular or should they be somewhat
	elongated (much like very short dashes)?

	Can dashed and dotted paths be filled?

	Can paths drawn as splines be filled?

	For ip and ia, should filling ONLY occur if shading has been
	explicitly specified?

	For fp, da, dt, should the path be explicitly closed if the 
	last point is the same as the first? (It matters, since
	`line join' rather than `line cap' comes into play if it is closed).

	Can the dash/dot interval argument be given in milli-inches 
	(like all other dimensions) or only in inches?


Possibly Desirable Extensions:
-----------------------------

	provide for shading of shape defined by quadratic spline

	provide for dashed/dotted ellipses

	provide for smoothly closing paths defined by quadratic splines

	allow paths to be built up from lines AND elliptic arcs.
