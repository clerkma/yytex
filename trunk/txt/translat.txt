TRANSLAT is a utility for converting a text file from one encoding 
to another.

Usage: E:\TRANSLAT.EXE <in-vector> <out-vector> [<in-filename>]

e.g.	translat  ibmoem  ansinew  mysource.tex

will convert `mysource.tex' from IBMOEM encoding (DOS code page 437)
to Windows ANSI (output in `mysource.tra').  Useful when a DOS text 
editor is used to create a file which is to be used in Windows.

When not given a file argument, TRANSLAT shows the translation table 
that it builds. 

This table may be used with Y&YTeX as an xchr[] array (use -x= on
the command line).  Remember that the xchr[] array is used for
*output* from TeX (translation from internal so-called `ASCII' to
output to user in error messages and such).  The array used for
*input* is xord[] which is constructed by TeX by inverting the
mapping in xchr[].  Hence, if your source code was created using
IBMOEM (DOS code page 437) and you want the DVI files to use
Windows ANSI for text fonts, then create a xchr[] table as follows:

	translat ansinew ibmoem > dostoans.map

and then use -x=dostoans on the Y&YTeX command line.  Note that you 
first want to build TeX formats *without* this, since source files
for most common formats (plain TeX, LateX, AMSTeX, SliTEX etc) are set
up for ordinary TeX text encoding.  Use the `-x=dostoans' only when
processing your own source file.
