Using different directories for the editor and TeX:
---------------------------------------------------

Note that you can keep two windows open:

	(1) your editor with the source file, and 
	(2) DVIWindo showing the DVI file.

These can be `connected' to different directories.  
You can always force selection of the appropriate directory by 
holding down the `Shift' key before selecting the editor
or TeX from the `TeX Menu'.  You will be presented with
a `File Open' dialog that allows you to choose any directory
you want before calling the editor and before calling TeX.

The editor then stays connected to the appropriate file
until you kill it.  Similarly, DVIWindo will pass the 
appropriate file name to TeX until you exit DVIWindo.

Most people find the `two window mode' the most efficient way
to operate, particularly if there is enough screen resolution
so you do not have to operate either DVIWindo or the editor 
full screen.  Then you can just click on one or the other window
to get the attention of the editor or DVIWindo as needed.

---------------------
Helpful Windows Notes:
---------------------

To switch between full screen and windowed mode, type `Alt' `Enter'

To switch between different windows, type `Alt' `Tab' 
(repeat if needed while holding down `Alt' key).

To change the size of a DOS window, change the font.  To select the font in a
DOS window, click on the system icon (top left corner of window) and select
`Fonts...'. Make sure to check the `Save Settings on Exit' box so this font
selection `sticks' for next time.

To control how a DOS session appears in Windows (for example, whether
your XYWrite editor comes up in full screen or windowed mode) use
the PIF Editor (in the Windows `Main' program group) to create a PIF
(Program Information File) for it.  This PIF file will then control
how Windows deals with that application in future.

Debugging calls from DVIWindo to DVIPSONE, editors, TeX etc
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can get detailed information on exactly what command line DVIWindo
has constructed when calling DVIPSONE, or for items from the TeX Menu by
adding -d on the dviwindo.exe command line.  

To do this, click (once) on the DVIWindo icon to select it. Then type `Alt'
`Enter'.   Add a space followed by -d to the end of the Command Line.

You'll want to remove this later when you don't need the debugging 
information anymore.

Paper size info for DVIPSONE:
-----------------------------

When DVIWindo calls DVIPSONE from the Print dialog, it passes paper size
information as set in `Preferences|Page Size' to DVIPSONE (using the -l=...
command line argument).  To achieve the same effect from a TeX Menu
entry for DVIPSONE, add the -l=... to the corresponding TeX Menu item
(between the `dvipsone.exe' or `dvipsone.bat' and the *.dvi or @.dvi).
