	Textures and Y&Y TeX:
=====================================

Textures on the Macintosh and Y&Y TeX System in Windows are similar.
For example, both use dynamic memory allocation in their TeX implementation.
Both are top-end, `power' applications for their respective platforms.

In addition, Y&Y TeX System makes it easy to use Textures files --- 
despite the lack of standardization in the TeX world of (i) font names, 
(ii) font encoding, (iii) use of \special for figure inclusion, color, etc.
This is because of Y&Y TeX System's unique flexibility.  For example,
Y&Y TeX System is the only TeX system on any platform that provides for 
`on the fly' font reencoding.  So it can even use Macintosh standard
roman character layout in Windows (if one wanted to do that)! 

Like Textures, one works with two Windows open in Y&Y TeX, one showing
the typeset result, the other the source file being edited.  After making
a change, three keystrokes refresh the display of the typeset results.
The underlying TeX and LaTeX are of course the same, so most everything
works "out of the box" without any customization.  But in addition:

* The DVIWindo previewer can read Textures files directly (Textures files
  contain the DVI file component in the resource fork).  

* DVIPSONE can also directly use Adobe Type 1 fonts in Macintosh format 
  (provided they are moved to the IBM PC in MacBinary format).

* Font Names.  Textures has its own unique convention for naming fonts
  other than Computer Modern.  It does not use the font file name, the
  PostScript FontName, or the QuickDraw font menu name.  A font naming 
  aliasing file can be set up so that Y&Y TeX System will work with files 
  using Textures font naming convention (use the file `texfonts.bsr' 
  supplied with Y&Y TeX and rename it `texfonts.map').

* Font encoding (character layout).  Textures has its own unique character
  layout for fonts other than Computer Modern fonts.  As default, it uses a
  version of Macintosh standard roman encoding that has been modified to better
  suit plain TeX and LaTeX.  The Y&Y TeX System can be asked to use the same
  encoding by means of its `on the fly' reencoding.  Simply set the ENCODING
  environment variable to `texmac' (the `texmac' encoding vector is provided).

* Use of \special for figure inclusion, color etc.  The screen viewer
  and printer drivers in Y&Y TeX System support the syntax invented for 
  literally one dozen other drivers, including Textures.  So figure inclusion
  using \special{illustration ...}, for example, will work as expected.  
  And so will Textures unique way of specifying colors.

In summary, in Windows, the closest thing to Textures is the Y&Y TeX System.
It is easy to migrate from Textures to Y&Y TeX System, and it is easy to
live in a mixed environment of Macintoshes and IBM PCs.

In addition, Y&Y TeX System has many `power features' not found in
other TeX systems --- including Textures --- such as fast PostScript
printing using `partial font downloading' on PostScript printers
(which also greatly reduces the change of running out of memory on
the printer), and access to *all* characters in a font using `on the
fly' font encoding (which also makes it easy to use completely
arbitrary user designed character layout).
