New items in "SPECIAL" menu in DVIWindo:
========================================

"Keep Console Open" (0)             Normally the Console Window closes after
                                    DVIPSONE or AFMtoTFM are done --- unless
                                    there was an error.  Checking this menu
                                    item keeps the window around for your
                                    perusal. No need to clear it before
                                    starting next task. 

"DVIPSONE Pass Back" (0)            Ask DVIPSONE.DLL to pass PostScript back
                                    to DVIWindo, rather then sending to
                                    output file or port directly.  DVIWindo
                                    then passes if back to the Windows
                                    printer driver using PASSBACK Escapes.

"Force PassBack" (0)                Normally when printing to file,
                                    DVIPSONE.DLL writes to the file directly.
                                    Checking this menu item forces it to pass
                                    back PS even when printing to file.
                                    Useful for debugging misfeatures of
                                    Windows printer drivers (except, they
                                    don't always send to file the same code
                                    they would send to a printer!).

"Force Postscript_Passthrough" (0)  Use POSTSCRIPT_PASSBACK even for printer
                                    drivers that are suspected to only
                                    support PASSBACK (Distiller works
                                    correctly and is special-cased to use
                                    POSTSCRIPT_PASSBACK).

"Don't ask file name" (0)           When printing to file, make up output
                                    file name based on source file name,
                                    but with extension "ps," rather than
                                    ask user for file name and path.
                                    Output files goes to same place the 
                                    DVI file came from (hence if Working
                                    Directory is set, the PS file appears
                                    there, and if it is not set the PS file
                                    appears where the source file came from.

"Use Open/Close Channel" (0)        An alternative to STARTDOC / ENDDOC
                                    Supposed to avoid including headers and
                                    trailers, but acts virtually the same as
                                    STARTDOC / ENDDOC.

You'll want to check the "DVIPSONE Pass Back" menu item
You may want to check the "Keep Console Open" menu item
When printing to file you may want to check "Don't ask File Name"

But First Add

AFMtoTFMDLL=1
DVIPSONEDLL=1

to the [Window] section of dviwindo.ini


==============
Other changes:
==============

The print dialog uses a new heuristic to guess whether a printer supports PS,
and checks "Use DVIPSONE" if so (it always did this, it just didn't work
anymore in WIN32...).  One can override this by clicking the check box. 
A USEDVIPSONE=... variable in the [Window] section of dviwindo.ini also
overrides this heuristic.  If such a variable exists, selecting a printer on
one of the ports listed in a semicolon-separated list of ports will cause the
checkbox to be checked.  Properties of the printer driver are ignored.

========================
Things that do not work:
========================

The old method for checking whether a driver supports PostScript using 
the GETTECHNOLOGY Escape does not work (the GETTECHNOLOGY Escape is not
implemented).

The old method for suppressing PSCRIPT header and trailer insertion
using EPSPRINTING Escape does not work (the EPSPRINTING Escape is
not implemented, neither is ENCAPSULATED_POSTSCRIPT).

The new method for avoiding header and trailer inclusion using OPENCHANNEL /
CLOSECHANNEL (instead of STARTDOC / ENDDOC) does not work (these new escapes
*are* implemented, just don't do what they say).  The only difference is that
line terminations are munged.

Using PASSTHROUGH Escapes makes the printer driver insert undesireable
header and trailer.  

Using POSTSCRIPT_PASSTHROUGH Escapes avoids insertion og headers and trailers
on drivers that implement it.  However, it does not work with PSCRIPT-based
printer drivers such as those for HP since it causes output to be truncated
(buffer is not flushed at end) and driver forgets to tell the spooler
that the job is done.  This can leave the printer in a bad state that
requires power cycling.  This Escape does work with Distiller though - and 
does prevent inclusion of PSCRIPT header and trailer.

POSTSCRIPT_IDENTIFY (a way to tell the driver whether the job
is GDI- or PS-centric) is not implemented.

POSTSCRIPT_INJECTION (another way to pass through PS code) is not
implemented. 

==============
DECISION TREE:
==============


if bUseDVIPSONE ?       FALSE   DVIWindo prints using GDI to windows drivers   

    else

if bUseDVIPSONEDLL ?    FALSE   call DVIPSONE.EXE via WinExe

    else

if bCallBack ?          FALSE   call DVIPSONE.DLL, but let it send output to port 

    else                            

                                call DVIPSONE.DLL and pass PS back to DVIWindo
                                DVIWINDO sends it back to the printer driver.
                                
NOTE:   "Print to File" checked normally implies bCallBack = FALSE

NOTE:   "Print to File" checked normally implies user will be asked
        for file name to send output to.  DVIWindo itself will
        ask if bUSEDVIPSONE is true, otherwise Windows will ask when
        STARTDOC Escape is sent.

NOTE:   To have Distiller show the PDF file after it is done, check
        "View PDF when using Distiller Printer" in "File > Preferences"
        of Distiller.
