		Installing the Y&Y  Complete TeX System from diskette
		=====================================================

It is assumed here that your diskette drive is `a:' and the hard disk is `c:'
Substitute appropriate drive letters for `a:' and `c:'

(1)	If you are using Windows 95, install ATM 3.02.  Insert the ATM diskette.
	Then, from the `Start' button, select `Run,' and enter 

		a:install

	Refer to `Installing ATM' in the ATM manual if there are problems.
	NOTE: do not install ATM 3.02 in NT -- use ATM 4.0 for NT if available.

(2)	Install the Fonts.  In Windows 95 use ATM to install the fonts (see *).
	In Windows NT, use the `Fonts' icon in the control panel (see **).
	Details differ slightly depending on which font set you are using:

    (2a)  `Computer Modern' fonts:  install straight off the diskettes.
	  The 75 CM fonts come on three diskettes. The 40 most used fonts
	  are on diskette A.  The remaining 35 fonts are on diskette B.  
	  NOTE: diskette C contains *only* utilities and ASCII text files.
	  Repeat for the `extra LaTeX + SliTeX' font diskette.

    (2b)  `Lucida Bright + Lucida New Math' font set: install straight off
	  diskette A.  Repeat for `Lucida Bright Expert' font set.
	  You need *not* use the `install.bat' batch file on the diskette.
	  NOTE:  The TFM files are already in c:\yandy\fonts\tfm-lb.
	  NOTE:  The TeX source files are already in c:\yandy\texinput
	  (See LB + LNM manual for additional details if neeeded).

    (2c)  `MathTime + Times' fonts:  Create a temporary directory.
	  Do *NOT* install the math fonts *DIRECTLY* from the diskette.
	  In Windows NT, copy fonts off the ATM diskette to c:\psfonts.
	  In the temporary directory run the `prepare' batch file:

		a:prepare  a:

	  Then install fonts MTSY, MTEX and MTMI from the temporary directory.
	  If you have MathTime Plus, repeat with the MathTime Plus diskette.
	  You need *not* use the `texttune.bat' batch file on the diskette.
	  NOTE:  The TFM files are already in c:\yandy\fonts\tfm-ps.
	  NOTE:  The TeX source files are already in c:\yandy\texinput
	  (See MathTime manual for additional details if needed).

(*)  Installing fonts using ATM:  Launch the ATM control panel.  ATM 3.02
     can be found in the `Main' program group (reached from `Start' button
     by selecting `Programs').  ATM 4.0 makes its own `Adobe' program group.
     Once in ATM, click `Add' and select the directory and/or drive with the
     fonts (drives listed last in ATM 3.02).  The ATM control panel will show 
     fonts available for installation.  Select them all and click `Add'.

(**) Installing fonts in Windows NT.  In NT 4.0 just drag the *.pfm files 
     to the \fonts folder.

(3)	Install the Y&Y TeX System itself.  Insert Y&Y TeX System diskette 1.
	In Windows 95 and NT 4.0: from `Start' button select `Run,' enter 

		a:setup

	For LaTeX 2.09 and/or LaTeX 2e support you will be prompted to insert 
	the first of the `LaTeX Support' diskettes and continue	installation.
	You can also install LaTeX Support separately later if you wish.

	Using the fonts in Adobe Type 1 format (`PostScript' fonts) with TeX:
	=====================================================================

If you are using the Y&Y `CM' TeX system then there is no need to change
anything in your TeX source file.  Simply use `plain TeX' or `LaTeX' from 
the `TeX Menu' in DVIWindo.  This will invoke the ready-made TeX `formats' 
set up for CM fonts (copied from the Y&Y TeX System diskettes).

The easiest way to use either MathTime or LucidaBright is to simply read in
the appropriate TeX macro header file in your TEX source file to switch fonts.

For example, for `LucidaBright + LucidaNewMath' fonts add one of the lines:

	\input lcdplain		% for plain TeX
or	\input lcdlatex		% for LaTeX 2.09
or	\usepackage{lucidbry}	% for LaTeX 2e

(If you use Lucida Expert with LaTeX 2.09, then use \input lcdltexp).
Similarly, for `MathTime + Times + Helvetica + Courier' fonts, add one of:

	\input mtplain		% for plain TeX
or	\input mtlatex		% for LaTeX 2.09
or	\usepackage[LY1,mtbold]{mathtime}	% for LaTeX 2e

(If you use MathTime Plus with plain TeX or AMS TeX use \input mtplainx).
And just comment out this line to switch back to CM when you wish.

IMPORTANT: If text fonts are set up for something other than `TeX text' 
encoding (used by CM fonts), then also add one of the lines before the 
above.  For plain TeX and LaTeX 2.09 use:

	\input texnansi		% TeX 'n ANSI encoding
or	\input ansiacce		% MS Windows ANSI encoding

For LaTeX 2e use instead:

	\usepackage[LY1]{fontenc} % TeX 'n ANSI (LY1)
or	\usepackage[ansinew]{texnansi} % Windows ANSI

Use this with all fonts other than CM fonts.  Note that the installation
default is TeX 'n ANSI encoding, which provides access to all 228 glyphs.

See /texinput/hello_LB.tex, hello_MT.tex, hello_EM.tex for sample useage.
