Other partial bug work-arounds (not needed with release 1.2.9):

There are three types of rules to be concerned about:

(1) Division rules generated by \over et al.  The thickness of these 
    is controlled by font dimension 8 of the math extension font.  
    In CM and LB, the default is 0.4pt and in MT it is 0.46pt. 
    You can check this setting using \write16{\the\fontdimen8\the\textfont3}

Suggested bug work around:  You can change this default thickness using:

	\fontdimen8\the\textfont3=0.502pt

However, note that TeX uses `default rulethickness' also for other purposes,
such as spacing in math formulas, positions of subscripts and superscripts,
etc.  Hence page layout may be affected. 

(2) The default thickness of lines when you do not specify the thickness
(e.g. if you leave out height for \hrule or width for \vrule) is
hard-wired into TeX as 0.4pt.  Normally you would not be able to change this.
Just make sure you specify all dimensions when using rules, and do not leave
some to default to 0.4pt. 

Alternatively, you can redefine \hrule and \vrule in terms of the original
\hrule and \vrule but with height and width respectively already specified 
as 0.502pt:

\let\oldhrule\hrule
\def\hrule{\oldhrule height 0.502pt}

Suggested bug work around:  

In Y&Y TeX you can change the default rule thickness from the command line 
using e.g. -P=32900 on the command line (units are TeX's scaled points).

(3) Top bars on radicals.  The thickness of these is controlled by the
`height' of the `radical' sign (that is, how much it rises above the
baseline).  In CMSY10 (char code 112) CMEX10 (char codes 112, 113, 114, 115)
this is 0.4pt.  It is 0.46pt in MathTime.  Unfortunatelt, you can't change
this without changing the TFM files... 

Suggested bug work around:  

In DVIPSONE you can change the minimum horizontal rule thickness from the
command line using e.g. -*C=32900 on the command line (TeX's scaled points).
This does not affect the layout.  Note that this adjustement applies only to
the height of rules, not the width.
