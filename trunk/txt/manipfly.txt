Font Manipulation Package:
=========================

The package of IBM PC compatible utilities for conversion between different
outline font file formats (Type 1) and between font metric formats includes: 

*	MACtoPFA --- Mac T1 outline font format ==> PC T1 font file format.

*	PFBtoMAC --- PC T1 font file format ==> Mac T1 font format.

*	PFBtoPFA --- Printer Font Binary (PC) ==> Printer Font ASCII (Unix).

*	PFAtoPFB --- Printer Font ASCII (Unix) ==> Printer Font Binary (PC).

*	AFMtoSCR --- Adobe Font Metrics ==> Mac screen font (FOND Res).

*	SCRtoAFM --- Mac screen font file ==> Adobe Font Metrics.

*	AFMtoPFM --- Adobe Font Metrics ==> MS Windows Font Metrics.

*	PFMtoAFM --- MS Windows Font Metrics ==> Adobe Font Metrics.

*	AFMtoTFM --- Adobe Font Metrics ==> {\TeX} Font Metrics.

*	TFMtoAFM --- {\TeX} Font Metrics ==> Adobe Font Metrics.

*	TFMtoMET --- {\TeX} Font Metrics ==> TeXtures Metric format.

*	METtoTFM --- TeXtures Metric format ==> {\TeX} Font Metrics.

* 	ReEncode --- Renencode PFB, PFA and AFM files.

*	PFAtoAFM --- extract AFM file from outline font file.

*	ReNameCH --- Rename characters in outline font file.

*	SideBear --- Extract, modify character sidebearings & advance widths.

* 	Composit --- Extract, modify & add composite characters to a font.

*	SubFont  --- Extract sub font containing only specified character set.

*	MergePFA --- Make new font by combining characters from two fonts.

*	TransFrm --- Simple geometric transformations of characters.

*	SafeSEAC --- make fonts with accented characters safe for ATM.

Conversions between different formats of Type 1 fonts do _not_ disturb the
hinting (unlike some other commercially available font manipulation software).

Note that the different font metric formats do not contain {\it exactly} the
same information.  In particular, PFM and TFM format do not contain an
explicit encoding vector (mapping of character codes to character names).
For this reason the user may specify an encoding when using PFMtoAFM or
TFMtoAFM.  For the user's convenience, all commonly used encoding vector
files are supplied  (including, of course, MS Windows ANSI, MacIntosh, IBM PC
OEM, Zapf Dingbats, ISO Latin~1, Adobe StandardEncoding, Adobe Symbol, Ventura
encoding, and ten different encodings used by {\TeX}'s Computer Modern fonts).

An extended comment syntax for AFM files provides for specification of the
information normally found in TFM files for which there is no predefined AFM
file syntax (allowing construction of TFM's for math fonts).  This can be
used to specify space width and glue, word space, and - most importantly -
the extra dimensions and size linkages in math fonts.  Sample AFMs for several
Computer Modern fonts containing these extra comments are included. 

The operation of the utilities is controlled by command line flags and
command line arguments. Each program shows a usage summary when invoked
without file arguments.  

*	Several additional utilities - not described here - are also included:
	DOWNLOAD, SERIAL, MODEX, NAMECASE, SPACIFY, and EXCHANGE.

Some sample batch files calling for the utilities are included.  
One processes the old MathTime fonts (version 1.0) from TeXplorators and
converts them to ATM compatible Adobe Type 1 format.  Another creates a
`faux' smallcaps font.
