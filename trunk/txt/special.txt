To TUG DVI Driver Standards Committee:

We applaud the efforts of the committee to establish standards for DVI
processing programs.  The publication of a draft standard is a major
milestone that will help guide the work of implementers.
We hope that you will agree with us that a draft standard should also
soon be published that standardizes usage of \special.

This is an URGENT plea for standardization of the use of \special in
TeX.  We recommend that while the definition of \special may be left
open-ended for future extension, a definite form be establish for
writing \special commands for simple figure inclusion.

It is not to be expected that one could anticipate all possible
uses for this powerful extension of the TeX language,
nor is it likely that the community could soon agree on
the details of how such extensions are to be implemented.
But this should not stand in the way of satisfying what has now
become an urgent need:  
a standard way of using \special to include figures in text.

Publishers, particularly those active in technical
areas, are rapdily moving towards use of author-supplied 
machine readable material, both for journal articles and books.  
In mathematical and scientific areas, text material is often best
communicated in the form of DVI files.  
Figures to be inserted are most commonly given in Encapsulated
PostScript form.

A major stumbling block to completion of the transition to 
electronic publishing is that every DVI processing program supports a
different convention for usage of the \special command.
This means that every job is a custom job.
Instead of a smooth operation involving only transfer of the
authors DVI and EPS files, serious programming effort is often
required to deal with yet another way of using \special.

Typically all that the author requires is a way of inserting an 
EPS defined figure at a given place in a TeX document.  
Our experience with a large number of author-supplied DVI files
indicates that the predominant use of \special is for simple figure insertion.
In a small number of cases the figure also needs to be scaled.  
We have yet to see a case where a figure needs to be shifted,
rotated, skewed or clipped. 
More importantly, no use is ever made of the ability to insert verbatim
PostScript commands, to call on PostScript functions native to a
particular DVI processing program or to produce overlays.
While these transformations represent interesting and
powerful extensions, they apparently are not vital to the
production of even the most sophisticated texts.

When the discussion of standards for DVI drivers first started, there
was little urgency, since the routine need for these capabilities
had not yet arisen outside a small number of research laboratories.
Progress in this field has been rapid, however, outpacing
deliberations of the standards committee, with journals rapidly
switching to machine readable material.
Similarly, books are now routinely produced from TeX output.
The time for publication of a simple standard for figure
insertion in papers and books is now.

We claim that:

(*) A standard for use of \special in DVI files is urgently needed NOW.

(*) Most user's requirements can be met by a very simple scheme.

(*) Hooks can be left for more sophisticated usage of \special 
    to be defined later, but debate over these extensions should not
    delay announcement of a standard for simple figure insertion.

(*) Dependence on internal details of a particular DVI processing
    programs or the PostScript prolog it uses are not acceptable.

(*) Exactly what standard is adopted is not as important as that 
    SOME standard be adopted SOON.

(*) If a standard cannot be soon agreed upon, it is vital that at
    least a working draft be circulated that can be used as a model
    by implementers. 

(*) In the absence of guidance from the TUG DVI driver standards
    committee, ad hoc de facto `standards' are emerging, since the 
    need for a standard is extreme.  These `standards' are not
    extensible or elegant.

You can perform an invaluable service to the community by soon
publishing a draft standard for usage of \special for simple figure
inclusion.  
The window of opportunity for influencing the developments in this
area is open now, but will not remain open indefinitely.
