EPSF file Preview issues		(file: preview.txt)
===========================================================

Q: Can DVIWindo show preview of EPS files?

A: Yes and No.  

If the EPS file *has* a preview it will be shown by DVIWindo.
Most Windows programs make EPS files with preview in TIFF form.
A few Windows programs make EPS files with preview in WMF form.
Some Unix programs make EPS files with preview in EPSI form.
DVIWindo supports all three preview formats!

In most Windows programs you can turn off the generation of previews.
Obviously you don't want to do this if you want to see the previews in 
DVIWindo (or if you plan to print to a non-PS printer).

DVIWindo cannot show `previews' of raw PostScript files since neither
DVIWindo not Windows itself has a full PostScript interpreter.

You can add a preview to a raw EPS file that does not have a preview using
Transverter Pro (from Insight Systems) or the public domain GhostScript.

Q: Can DVIWindo print EPS files to non-PostScript devices?

A: Yes and No.

Non-PS devices obviously cannot interpret the PostScript code in EPS files.
However, DVIWindo will print the preview when printing on a non-PS device.

If you have a choice in preview format consider the following:

For images (rectangular raster of grey-levels or color) TIFF is the 
best format. 

For graphics (curves, vectors, graphs), WMF is the best format,
since it is not rasterized and hence resolution independent.

Of course, the application creating the EPS files may not offer a choice.
