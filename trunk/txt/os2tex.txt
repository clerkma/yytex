	Running the Y&Y TeX System runs in OS 2/2.1		(o2stex.txt)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) OS/2 assigns some meaning to & on the command line.  So it is best to
    avoid file names and directory names like `y&ytex.'  The standard
    installation uses instead `yandytex.'  For the same reason, the default
    entries in the `TeX' menu use + instead of & to designate a format
    for TeX to load (e.g. tex +lplain ... instead of tex &lplain ...)

    If you are moving from an older Windows 3.1 installation, first
    rename `y&ytex.exe' to `yandytex.exe', create a `yandytex' directory 
    and copy everything from the `y&ytex' directory.  Then update the
    `dviwindo.ini' file by replacing all references to `y&ytex' with
    `yandytex,' and all references to &lplain and &latex with +lplain
    and +latex respectively.  

    Also check batch files `tex.bat', `latex.bat' and `initex.bat'


(2) By default, OS/2 limits DOS Boxes to 2 MB of virtual memory.  
    This is often not enough for Y&Y TeX, particularly if you use
    many fonts, have a complex document, or are running ini-TeX. 
    To increase this limit, you need to: 
    
    (a)	Click the right mouse button on the DOS window icon to bring 
        up the menu.

    (b) Choose the Open Settings selection.

    (c)	Click on the Session page button.

    (d)	Click on the DOS Settings button.

    (e)	Click on DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT to change the setting.


(3) DVIWindo needs at least version 2.6 of ATM (preferably 3.0).  DVIWindo
    checks when it starts what version of ATM is running, and complains if
    it is less than 2.6.  Unfortunately, the version number of ATM is
    mis-reported in OS 2, so this sanity check does not work in OS 2.  
    If you are installing a new Y&Y TeX System make sure to install the ATM
    included with that.  If you are installing an upgrade check the version
    and if necessary upgrade to the latest version of ATM (we can provide a
    free upgrade from ATM 2.5 to ATM 2.6). 


(4) OS 2 uses a different font metric file format (OFM) than that used by
    Windows (PFM).  If your version of ATM is unable to properly install
    fonts directly from the diskette (which have PFB and PFM files), then
    copy all PFB files on the diskette to a temporary directory, add all of
    the AFM and INF files (found in the AFM directory on the diskette).  
    Then install the fonts from that temporary directory  (NOTE: This should
    not normally be neccessary).
