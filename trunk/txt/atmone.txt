Some additional notes about ATM beyond the ATM manual (this is `atmone.txt')
============================================================================

See ATMTWO.TXT for:	 TECHNIQUES FOR FIXING BROKEN ATM SETUPS.

NOTE:	If you have a version of ATM earlier than 2.6, please upgrade.
	If you have Acrobat Reader, you are in good shape, since it comes
	with ATM 2.6.  With ATM 2.6 and later you can add `Remap=0' to your
	`dviwindo.ini'  - if you like - to finally disable one of the bug
	work-arounds needed for earlier versions of ATM. 

	If you presently have ATM 2.5 (or ATM 2.51), you can upgrade
	to ATM 2.6 for free --- which is pretty amazing given that ATM 2.6
	is a total rewrite, almost bug free, and supports Multiple Masters!
	Get the file `25TO26.ZIP' from Adobe BBS (408) 562-6839, or, on
	CompuServe (GO ADOBE) in the ATM/PC library.  Or from ftp.adobe.com.
	Highly recommended!

	Actually, you can even get the guts of ATM 3.01 for free.  Just get
	the free Acrobat Reader for Windows (acroread.exe).  When you run it,
	it installs the Acrobat Reader and the DLL's for ATM 3.01.  The only
	part of ATM 3.01 which you don't get is the new control panel
	(which means you can't make new instances of Multiple Master fonts).

	While ATM 2.6 has a couple of minor and one not so minor bug, most
	of the bugs in older versions of ATM have gone away.  We have been
	able to cut out half of this file now that everyone is using ATM
	2.6 or later! 

*	We recommend NOT using any older version than 2.6 !	<==========

	In fact, for Y&Y TeX System 1.2 you must use ATM release 2.6 or later.

If you are having a problem with ATM, skip directly to the `TROUBLESHOOTING'
section, as well as section 1.7.

==================================
1. USING ADOBE TYPE MANAGER (ATM) 
==================================

This section explains a number of the subtle (and not so subtle) details
regarding use of ATM with PostScript and PCL printers.

1.1 ATM MEMORY REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------

ATM uses about 500K of RAM (more for ATM 3.0), depending on the size of the
font cache you have set up.  If you have only 2 megabytes of RAM, you may
find that applications runs slowly with ATM on. You may feel justified in
buying more memory (while Windows itself does run in 4 meg, it doesn't
run well in anything less than 8 Meg)

*	Do NOT run ATM with the `factory default' of only 96k of cache.
*	Try at least 256k.  Peformance with 96k can be *very* slow. <=========

1.2 THE RETAIL VERSION VERSUS THE BUNDLED VERSION OF ATM 
--------------------------------------------------------

The Y&Y TeX System includes ATM 3.01 with no fonts (white envelope).

The MathTime font set comes with the `retail ATM' which includes ATM 3.01
and 20 fonts, including the *real* Times-Roman and Helvetica.

Other font sets come with the `bundled' ATM (in a colorful envelope),
please note that this `bundled' version of ATM uses different fonts from
those available in the standard `retail' version (in a box, or with Acrobat).
Specifically, the `bundled' version provides:

	TimesNewRomanPS		instead of	Times; and
	GillSans or Arial MT	instead of	Helvetica.  

If you have already installed the retail version of ATM, you can 
still install the bundled version to add TimesNewRomanPS and GillSans 
(or Arial MT) to your "Font" submenu.   But you probably don't need them.

Note that the Acrobat Reader comes with the *real* Times and Helvetica fonts!

SUGGESTION: In general, eliminate as many lines as possible from the 
	[Synonyms] and [Aliases] section of ATM.INI as possible. 
	Usually many of these lines are either redundant or left over 
	from earlier ATMs. In some cases they form circular loops!

	BUT: Keep the line `Courier=Courier' to make sure ATM gives you the
	font size you request for Courier.  See below.

	And you do not want a line like:	Times=TimesNewRomanPS
	(unless you don't have Times-Roman).

1.3 USING THE MOST RECENT PCL PRINTER DRIVER
---------------------------------------------

If you are using ATM 2.5 or later, then be aware that it creates
downloadable `softfonts' instead of whole page bitmaps.  So the following
does NOT apply if you are using ATM 2.5 in its default mode:

If you print to a PCL printer using ATM fonts and get jagged, bitmapped
text, you may not be using the most recent printer driver.  If this
happens, and you have selected the correct resolution (300 dpi) in the
Windows "Printer Setup" dialog box, call Microsoft Corporation and ask for
an updated version of the driver. (Drivers are also available from their
BBS service at (206) 936-6735).

If your HP printer ejects pages before they are completed, then you are
using more softfonts per page than it can handle.  In this case, check
`Print fonts as Graphics' in the ATM control panel.  This slows printing
but solves the problem.

1.4 PERFORMANCE VS. OUTPUT QUALITY
-----------------------------------

*	Do NOT run ATM with the  "Use Pre-built or Resident Bitmap Fonts" 
*	CHECKED in the ATM control panel.		<================

ATM has a check box in its Control Panel called "Use Pre-built or
Resident Bitmap Fonts."  If you installed the bundled version of ATM,
this option is unchecked (off) by default; with the retail version, 
it is checked (on).  Unless your printer has fairly low memory 
(1 megabyte or less), we strongly recommend that this option be UNCHECKED.  
ATM will then create outline (scalable) fonts in all cases, with a
consistent set of font metrics for each point size. 

If you leave this option checked, ATM uses whatever bitmapped fonts it has,
creating outline fonts only when necessary.  When bitmapped and outline
fonts are mingled in this way, your fonts will not have a consistent
appearance across all point sizes.  Although using pre-built, bitmapped
fonts can improve performance, it will do so at the expense of text that
may be incorrectly positioned because of varying type sizes and widths.
You don't want this!

1.5 - 1.8 now obsolete!

1.9 PRINTING COLORED ATM TEX
-----------------------------

If you print colored text with the "Color as black" option in the
"Print" dialog box unchecked, the lighter colors will not be printed
to PCL printers.

If you print colored fonts on a black/white printer, the colors will
be translated to gray-levels and you will get spotty or mottled letters.

1.10 ATM TEXT DISPLAY
----------------------

The default is for ATM to show text on the screen slightly (3%) narrower
than it appears when printed.  This effect is more noticeable, of course,
at larger point sizes.  To correct this text display, DVIWindo
installation adds the following line to the [SETTINGS] section of your
ATM.INI in your Windows directory:

	ScreenAdjust=Off

Without this change character positioning on screen will not be accurate.

1.11 WHEN POSTSCRIPT PRINTER DRIVER CANNOT FIND FONTS
------------------------------------------------------

If, after ATM is already installed, you install a new printer that's
similar or identical to one you already assigned to a different port,
ATM fonts will not be available when you target the new printer.  
The problem is that ATM does NOT automatically conclude that the two
printers should have the same set of fonts.

If your ATM font names display a question mark in the "Font" submenu,
reinstall your ATM fonts.  In the installation process, ATM will read
the WIN.INI file and thereby learn about the new port assignments. 

Your PostScript printer driver will also not be able to find the fonts.
The cure: reinstall the fonts.  Also see `systemic purge' in `atmtwo.txt'.

-----------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL HINTS AND TIPS

>> Hebrew version of Windows

"ATM expects and depends on text output in specific locations within
windows.  Providing transparent Hebrew suppoer required relocation of the
Windows text output routine. Because of this ATM will not run on the Hebrew
3.1 version of Windows". 

>>	Maximum number of fonts

The maximum number of fonts that can be installed for ATM 2.0 is about 900.

IMPORTANT NOTE: However, the Windows 3.1 PostScript driver has a lower limit,
somewhere around 320.  So if you are using a PostScript printer you will
not be able to install more than that many fonts.  

*	The main limit is that the files WIN.INI and ATM.INI must be less
*	than 64k.  You get weird and wonderful results -- without warning ---
*	when WIN.INI exceeds 64k.  One - rather minor - symptom is that the
*	end of the file gets truncated.  Limit the number of different ports
*	for the PS printer, since a complete list of softfonts is maintained
*	for *each* port (at least with MicroSoft's current PS printer driver).

If you have more than the allowed number of fonts, you will not be able to
print, and may in fact get unexpected application errors --- there is no
message telling you that the limit has been exceeded. 

Also note that some operations, such as `Printer Setup' slow down a LOT 
when there are a large number of fonts installed.  However, the latest 
Windows PostScript printer driver has much less of a problem with this.  
Get PSCRIPT.DRV version 3.55 or later from MicroSoft.  Drivers are 
available from MicroSoft's BBS service at (206) 936-6735 - download 
PSCRIP.EXE, place this file in an empty directory, and then run it to
extract the new PSCRIPT.DRV and PSCRIPT.HLP files.
The new driver is also included with Windows 3.11 (Windows for WorkGroups).
And PSCRIPT.DRV 3.58 is included with the Windows 3.11 upgrade.
GO MSL on CompuServe, and download the file WW0981.EXE

Also note that many applications (such as MicroSoft Word for Windows)
have their own internal limitations on number of fonts they can handle
in the menu.  Those above the limit that appear at the end of the softfonts
lists in WIN.INI will be dropped without notice.

>>	Windows vector fonts

ATM will substitute its scalable TimesNewRoman and GillSans for Window's
Roman and Modern, respectively, in order to eliminate the "stick-
figure" appearance of these fonts.  If you don't want ATM to make 
this substitution, delete the following two lines from the 
[Aliases] section of your ATM.INI file:

	Roman=TimesNewRomanPS
	Modern=GillSans

This is the only way you would see Roman and Modern. 

>>	PostScript printer font downloading

The "Add font" option in the ATM Control Panel adds the selected fonts
to every PostScript printer in WIN.INI as `automatic downloaded' fonts 
(at least in ATM versions 2.0).  See above.

>>	Re-installing ATM

If you already have a version of ATM installed on your system, 
turn it off using the ATM Control Panel and restart Windows before 
running the ATM Installer.

>>	Font cache setting

If you set ATM's font cache to be larger than the amount of memory 
available on your PC, you may not be able to run the ATM Control 
Panel.  If this happens, quit Windows and use a DOS editor (such 
as edlin) to delete the line "FontCache=xxx" in the ATM.INI file.  
Then re-start Windows and use the ATM Control Panel to set the 
font cache to the desired value.  

NOTE: Running ATM with the default 96k cache is not reasonable.
      Rendering will be *very* slow.		<==============

------------------------------------------------------------

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem:  The "Add Font" option in the ATM Control Panel does not work 
with Monotype font packages.

Solution:  Rename the outline font (.PFB) filenames to be the same as 
the corresponding metrics (.PFM) filenames before using the ATM 
Control Panel to add these fonts.

Problem: Justified text sometimes extends beyond the right margin on screen.

Solution: Turn off the "Use pre-built or resident bitmap fonts" 
option in the ATM Control Panel.  

Problem:  Italic or script fonts are sometimes clipped at the end of a 
line or at the current cursor position.

Solution:  This is a limitation of Windows and affects only screen 
display of text.  The text will print correctly with ATM.

Problem:  Ventura Publisher v3.0 displays a "Divide by zero" error  message.

Solution:  This is due to the way Ventura Publisher manages font 
information.  Exit Ventura Publisher, remove some fonts using the 
ATM Control Panel, and restart Windows.

Problem:  Selecting text in Ami Professional 1.2 seems sluggish.

Solution:  Turn off the "Pair Kerning" option in Ami's Defaults menu 
until you are ready to print.  The sluggishness also occurs without 
ATM when using printers that support automatic kerning (such as 
PostScript printers).  The sluggishness is due to Ami's extra 
overhead in doing its kerning calculations.

Problem:  Courier text is clipped at sizes below 9 point on screen and 
on printed output.

Solution:  In order to avoid problems with a few applications that do 
not handle Courier correctly, ATM must return a fixed size screen 
bitmapped font for small sizes.  You can change this by deleting the 
following line from the [Aliases] section of your ATM.INI file:
	Courier=Courier
ATM will then provide the exact (unclipped) size of Courier requested 
by your applications.  Note that some applications don't expect to 
actually receive the size they requested.  For example, the numbers 
in the ruler of AmiPro will be displayed in 1 point type.

Problem:  Helvetica text appears unreadably small.
Some ill-behaved applications ask for fonts of size 1,
expecting to get instead the smallest bitmapped font available.
ATM instead actually gives them the size requested.

Solution: Remove the line
	Helv=Helvetica
in ATM.INI
