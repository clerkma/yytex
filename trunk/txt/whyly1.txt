Why LY1?

(1) Access all the characters in typical PST1 text font using a 
    single font encoding (including dagger, daggerdbl, and
    paragraph --- used in footnote markers --- copyright, register,
    trademark etc.)

(2) No slots wasted on characters that are typically not found in 
    PST1 text fonts (e.g. Eng, Tcedilla, Dcroat, Lcaron

(3) Enables hyphenation in TeX when using accented characters.

(4) Support under plain TeX, LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX 2e --- not just LaTeX 2e.

(5) Almost transparent support for the old OT1 encoding.

(6) No need for VF -- see (1) and (2).

(7) No need for `text companion' (TS1) encoding -- see (1) and (2).

(8) A *single* TFM file instead of four TFMs plus two VF files.

(9) No struggles with tools like fontinst, VPtoVF, VFtoVP etc.
