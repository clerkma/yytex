============================================================================
    ATM 4.0 for Windows 95/98, ATM 4.0 for Windows NT, and Base 13 fonts.
============================================================================

Windows 95/98: To install ATM 4.0, double click `My Computer', then `ATM',
			   then `Win95', and finally `install.exe'		

Windows NT 4:  To install ATM 4.0, double click `My Computer', then `ATM',
			   then `NT4', and finally `setup.exe'		

The above procedure will also install the `Base 13' fonts
(Times, Helvetica, and Courier families, and Symbol).
These are the fonts recently revised by Adobe for PostScript 3, 
with improved hinting and improved kerning pairs.

If you are installing ATM 4.0 from a Y&Y TeX System CD, then the 
above will *also* install the fonts that came with the TeX system.  
If you need to install just ATM itself, without these additional fonts, 
then install from `\ATM\Win95_NoFonts' or `\ATM\NT4_NoFonts' instead.

Trouble Shooting:

In Windows 95, if you have many fonts, you may run out of space
in win.ini, which is limited to 64k bytes.  This happens when
you have several [PostScript,...] sections for different printers.
You can either remove the sections you don't need, or change the
preference settings in ATM control panel.

You get to the ATM control panel using `Start > Programs > Adobe > ATM'
Select the `Settings' tab and click on `MS PostScript Driver'.
Click on `Mark as Not to be installed for PostScript Printer'.
This does mean that you won't be able to print to PostScript devices 
with these fonts from Windows applications.

If you are using a PCL printer in Windows 95/98 then you may have
problems with reencoded fonts. One way to try and work around this bug 
in the MS and HP printer drivers is to check `Print Fonts as Graphics'
in the `Advanced' section of the `Settings' tab of the ATM control panel.
If this doesn't solve the problem, look for settings like 
`Print TrueType fonts as bitmaps' or `Print whole page as bitmap'
in the printer driver reached from `Start > Settings > Printers'.
