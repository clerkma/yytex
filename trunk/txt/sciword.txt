See the file `texref.doc' in the `sciword\extras' directory of Scientific
Word for some information about using DVIWindo for previewing and printing,
using DVIPSONE for printing to PostScript devices, using Y&YTeX instead of
TurboTeX, and using fonts other than Computer Modern with LaTeX in
Scientific Word.  

The changes and additions needed are to the file `sciword.ini' in your
Windows directory.  Like other Windows `ini' files, this file is divided into
sections, each starting with a word surrounded by brackets ([...]).  Sections
are separated by blank lines, and any line starting with a `;' is considered
a comment, and hence ignored.  In the instructions below, please replace `c:'
with the drive letter where the corresponding files may be found on your
system, and adjust the file paths and names appropriately. 


Asking Scientific Word to use DVIWindo for previewing:
------------------------------------------------------

DVIWindo is a previewer that allows previewing of files calling for scalable
outline fonts (e.g. PostScript Type 1 and TrueType).  The TurboTeX previewer
works with PK bitmapped fonts instead (and so is restricted to fixed
magnificaiton).  You can ask Scientific Word to link to DVIWindo for
previewing as follows:

In the [TeX] section of the file `sciword.ini', comment out the line:

	TeXPreviewer=c:\sciword\tex\wdviwin, -z

and add the line:

	TeXPreviewer=c:\dviwindo\dviwindo,,2


Asking Scientific Word to use DVIWindo for printing:
----------------------------------------------------

In addition to being a previewer, DVIWindo can also print to any device
with a Windows printer driver including HP, IBM, dot-matrix, PS, even fax
boards and Adobe Acrobat PDF.

In the [TeXDriver] section of the file `sciword.ini' add the line

	default=DVIWindo: Apple LaserWriter II NT on LPT1:

Replace `Apple LaserWriter II NT' in the above with the name of your 
printer as noted under `device=' in the [windows] section of your `win.ini' 
file.  Also replace `LPT1:' with the appropriate port, as noted in the
`device=' entry in `win.ini'.  The above example corresponds to the 
following `win.ini' entry: 

	device=Apple LaserWriter II NT,pscript,LPT1:

The `device=' entry in the [windows] section applies to the default printer, 
If the printer you wish to use is not the default printer, then look in the
[devices] section of `win.ini' for the corresponding information for 
printers installed in Windows other than the default printer.

Also add the following line to the [TeXDriver] section of `sciword.ini':

	TeXDriver3=DVIWindo,c:\dviwindo\dviwindo,*,N,,N{}{-b=1 -e=2}{}


Asking Scientific Word to use DVIPSONE for printing:
----------------------------------------------------

DVIPSONE is the only program of any kind using `partial font downloading' of
Adobe Type 1 fonts (a.k.a `PostScript' fonts).  While you can certainly print
from DVIWindo to a PostScript printer, the PostScript file produced will be
as large as that produced by other DVI-to-PS printer drivers, and printing as
slow.  You may also run out of printer memory if you have an older printer
and are using lots of fonts (as is common when using TeX).

The easiest way to link to DVIPSONE for printing to PostScript printers is to
have Scientific Word link to DVIWindo, and to set up DVIWindo ahead of time
to use DVIPSONE.  To do this, launch DVIWindo, open some DVI file, select
`Print' from the `File' menu and check the box next to `Use DVIPSONE'.  When
DVIWindo is closed it will save this setting in the `dviwindo.ini' file and
hence use DVIPSONE for printing when it is later called from Scientific Word.

If the `Use DVIPSONE' check box does not appear in the dialog box, then
either DVIPSONE is not installed, or DVIPSONE.EXE is not on the DOS path.


Asking Scientific Word to use Y&YTeX:
-------------------------------------

Y&YTeX is the only `dynamic' TeX that can run in DOS or Windows.  TurboTeX,
on the other hand is a slower, Windows-only `small' TeX that can easily run
out of memory.  You may find it advantageous to use Y&YTeX instead of
TurboTeX.  Actually, you may not have much of a choice if you use fonts other
than Computer Modern, since you then most likely will run out of font space
in *any* `small TeX' implementation. 

Note that Y&YTeX requires at least a 386 computer and at least 1.6 meg of
*free* RAM.  So the machine should have at least 4 meg installed (and if
there are only 4 meg, then not much of it should be used for RAM disks,
SMARTDRV cache, ATM cache, and print buffers).  Use the DOS `mem' command
to see how much memory of various flavors you have available.  (Note that
in a DOS box in Windows, the amount available is under-reported, since
Windows grabs it, but is prepared to give it to processes asking for it). 

In the [TeX] section of the file `sciword.ini', comment out the line

	LaTeX=2, c:\sciword\tex\wlatex,

and add the line

	LaTeX=1,c:\y&ytex\y&ytex &lplain,

You'll also have to make sure that the environment variables are set for
TeX.  In particular, add `c:\sciword\tex\macros' to `texinputs'. For example:

	set texinputs=c:\y&ytex\latex;c:\sciword\tex\macros

Additional semicolon-separated directories with TeX source files may be added.

The environment variables are set up in `setyytex.bat', a batch file
created during installation of Y&YTeX.  Lines from this batch file
may already have been appended to your `autoexec.bat'.  It is usually
most convenient to set environment variables from `autoexec.bat'.

If you are using Windows ANSI encoding for ordinary text fonts, then
please add `Set TEXANSI=1' to your autoexec.bat file so that DVIPSONE
*also* reencodes text fonts to use Windows ANSI encoding.


Inserted EPS figures --- printing with DVIPSONE and previewing with DVIWindo:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable printing by DVIPSONE of EPS figures inserted using Scientific Word,  
use the command line flag -*S.

To enable previewing in DVIWindo of EPS figures inserted using Scientific
Word, add the line

	SciWord=1

to the [Window] section of your `dviwindo.ini' file.

(The reason these capabilities are not automatically enabled is that
Scientific Word uses a \special syntax for inserted EPS files that
conflicts with that used by other drivers such as DVIPS).

You may find that one of the other schemes for insertion of EPS figures
provides more capabilities than that used by Scientific Word (such as scaling
of the figure).  Please refer to the DVIPSONE or DVIWindo manual. You can use
Scientific Word's `TeX Field' mechanism to define your own \special using one
of the other schemes. 

You may want to use Tom Rokicki's `EPSF.TEX' (see `epsfsafe.tex') or Trevor
Darrell's PSFIG.STY (see `psfigfix.txt') as a high level interface for EPS
figure inclusion.

Note that DVIWindo and DVIPSONE *also* support inclusion of TIFF images.
