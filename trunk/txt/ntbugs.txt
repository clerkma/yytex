		Windows NT 3.51 font installer bugs:
======================================================================

The automatic conversion from Type 1 to TrueType when installing fonts in
Windows NT 3.51 has been much improved compared to that in Windows NT 3.50.
Nevertheless, there remain some problems.

The main problem is that the automatic conversion installs the font under the
wrong name.  The converter does produce TTF and FOT files that use the
PostScript FullName as the TrueType FullName, but then it installs the font
under the PostScript FontName instead!  Which means that the relationship
between font name and file name cannot be recovered by an application.  
The information entered into the registry is wrong (unless the PS FullName
happens to be the same as the PS FontName, which is the case with CM fonts).

The fix for this problem is:

(1) install the Type 1 fonts from `Fonts' in the `Control Panel' (found
    in the `Main' program group).  Make sure to check all three boxes
    (`Convert Type 1 Font to TrueType', `Install Type 1 Font Files for use on 
    a PostScript Printer', and `Copy Type 1 Font Files to Windows Directory');
    During this installation you will probably see font names *without* spaces
    between name components, such as `LucidaBright'.  These are the *wrong*
    names. 

(2) copy the corresponding TTF and FOT files from the system directory
    (typically c:\windows\system) to an empty temporary directory.
    (Check the font diskette for file names of the PFB and PFM files, 
    the converted TTF and FOT files will have the same name with different 
    extension).

(3) *remove* the fonts again using `Fonts' in `Control Panel.'  
    Make sure to check the `Delete Font File from Disk' box. 

(4) reinstall the fonts from the temporary directory using `Fonts' in the
    Control Panel  During this `installation' you will probably see font
    names with spaces between name components, such as `Lucida Bright'.
    (When using the TTF / FOT files the installer picks up the correct name). 

While the above sounds relatively straightforward, some mis-features of
Windows NT can conspire to make this a somewhat frustrating process:

(1) `Removing' the fonts may not in fact delete the corresponding TTF and FOT
    files from the system directory (typically c:\windows\system).  You may
    want to check, and delete the files manually if they are still there.
    However, you may find that you cannot delete the TTF or FOT files from
    the system directory --- you may get an error message that the files are
    `in use by another process' (presumably the TrueType font rasterizer in
    Windows NT).   This happens particularly if an attempt has already been
    made to use the font for on screen display.

*   The only way out is to reboot and then try again to delete the files. 

    It is important to delete these files to avoid cluttering your disk with
    several copies of the same font, and getting the system (or yourself)
    confused about which version of a font is installed.

(2) Windows NT does a poor job of managing TTF and FOT files.  It does not
    delete or overwrite old versions when you install a new version of a font.
    Instead, it adds a version number to the end of the file name.  After a
    while you can end up with numerous copies of the same font file, and you
    may not know which of these is actually being used (of course, this
    wouldn't be much of a problem if you didn't always have to reinstall
    auto-converted font, as described above).  

*	The solution is to always make sure to first delete the old TTF and
*	FOT files --- do not depend on `Delete Font File from Disk' check box.  

(3) Windows NT does a poor job of managing font information in the registry.
    You may find that the information there is not in synch with reality.
    There may be fonts listed there for which there are no TTF or FOT files
    (and there may be fonts `installed' for which there is no entry in the
    registry).  The best solution is to use the registry editor to open

*	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts

    then highlight fonts to be removed and press delete, then click on `Yes'.
    Again this wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that
    you have to reinstall autoconverted fonts.  

    The registry editor is regedit32.exe in the system32 directory (typically
    c:\windows\system32).  You can set up an icon to make it convenient to
    call the Registry Editor (Use `New' in the `File' menu of Progam Manager).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After (re-)installing the `Lucida Bright + Lucida New Math' font sets you
should have entries of the form:

	Lucida Blackletter (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBL.FOT
	Lucida Bright (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBR.FOT
	Lucida Bright Italic (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBI.FOT
	Lucida Bright Demibold (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBD.FOT
	Lucida Bright Demibold Italic (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBDI.FOT
	Lucida Bright Oblique (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBSL.FOT
	Lucida Calligraphic Italic (TrueType): REG_SZ: LBC.FOT

(1) If you instead have file names like LBL____0.FOT, then you most likely
    have  multiply copies of the font files, and may run into problems
    because the wrong version is used, see above.

(2) If the font names do not have spaces between name components --- 
    e.g. `LucidaBright Oblique' instead of `Lucida Bright Oblique' --- 
    then you have the fonts installed under the wrong name.  You need to
    reinstall the TTF and FOT files, see above. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some Other issues:
------------------

When Type 1 fonts are installed using the Windows NT font installer (instead
of Adobe Type Manager), the PFB and PFM files end up in the system directory,
not in the PSFONTS directory.  Set the PSFONTS environment variable in the
[Environment] section of `dviwindo.ini' so it includes this directory
(e.g. PSFONTS=c:\windows\system).  (You don't need to do this on a dual boot
configuration where the fonts are already installed in the PSFONTS directory
under ATM in Windows 3.1 or Windows 95).

The Font Installer in Windows NT ignores the face name information in the
PFM files of Type 1 fonts.  This has several consequences:

(1) Face names shown in font menus are different in Windows NT from
    what they are under Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.  For example,
    the font with Window face name `LucidNewMathArrT' will appear as
    `Lucida New Math Arrows' in Windows NT.  

    This does not affect the Y&Y TeX System since the name by which TeX
    refers to the font is not the Windows face name, but the font's file
    name.

(2) Font families with many styles will be installed in such a way that only
   four of these styles are accessible.  For example, `Lucida Sans' has
   six styles: `regular', `italic, `demibold, `demibold italic, `bold'
   `bold italic'.  The Windows face name of the first four is `Lucida Sans'
   while the Windows face name of the last four is `Lucida Sans Bold'.
   Since Windows NT ignores the Windows face name, all six are merged
   under the name `Lucida Sans'.  Consequently only four of the six styles
   are accessible then using `bold' and `italic' style flags.

   For example, if you try to select `Lucida Sans Bold' or `Lucida Sans
   Bold Italic' in `Fonts' from the `Control panel' then nothing will be
   displayed and you may get an error message of the form `There is a problem
   with the font file.  Cannot display font' (And if you try to use `lsb'
   or `lsbi' from DVIWindo you will get `Can't find font lsb' and `Can't find
   font lsbi' 

   The only work around for this problem would be to change the PostScript
   FullName before conversion, which would make the fonts incompatible with 
   versions used under other operating systems.

The automatic conversion of Type 1 to TrueType fonts does not work properly
with fonts that have a FontMatrix other than the standard one.  This can
affect `narrow', `expanded' and `obliqued' styles.

TrueType fonts cannot be reencoded.  As a result plain text fonts will appear
with Windows ANSI encoding.  Use \input ansiacce in your source file
(and use the TFM files set up for Windows ANSI --- those with extension TFA).

If you must use another encoding, then `hard reencode' the Type 1 fonts
*before* conversion to TrueType using the `encode.bat' batch file.

NOTE: Adobe is working on an Adobe Type Manager for Windows NT, which will
      take care of all of these problems and improve font rendering also.
