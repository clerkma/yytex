(1) New `delta' in CM (and AMS) math italic fonts

Together with Blue Sky Research we have redone the CM math fonts with 
Donald Knuth's redesigned Greek `delta' in the math italic fonts.
This affects 7 fonts in the main CM font set and 3 fonts in the AMS font sets.

1a	No change in charge for the end user license.  However:

1b	To `upgrade' existing CM font set, the charge is $25 + shipping.
1c	To `upgrade' existing AMS font set, the charge is $15 + shipping.
1d	To `upgrade' both CM and AMS font set, the charge is $35 + shipping.


(2) `extra AMS fonts'

We have added a third diskette to AMS font set for IBM PC and Unix.
This contains an additional 16 `in between' sizes (6pt, 8pt, 9pt) for 
the CM bold math fonts and the AMS math symbol fonts 
(beyond the 35 fonts in the original AMS font set in Type 1 format).
This is to distinguish our offering from others, such as the font
set offered by Blue Sky Research which contains the basic 35 fonts.

2a	No change in what we charge for the end user license.  However:

2b	If someone with AMS font set wants this add-on, charge $50 + shipping.


(3) The MathTime Plus font set is ready - but *only* for IBM PC so far -
    and only support for plain TeX and AMS TeX. Twelve fonts altogether.
    This adds bold math support, upright Greek letters and a Script face.

3a	MathTime Plus end user license: $175 
	(No discount for people who have MathTime 1.1, since few would 
	buy MathTime Plus without already having MathTime 1.1)

3b	The MathTime Complete set is MathTime 1.1 + MathTime Plus.
	MathTime Complete end user license: $225

3c	Y&Y MathTime Plus TeX System: $395 educational $425 non-educational.


(4) We have added seriffed fonts to the `Lucida Sans Typewriter' font set and
    renamed it `Lucida Fixed Width'.  It used to contain only sans serif fonts
    (Lucida Sans Typewriter, Lucida Sans Typewriter Narrow, Lucida Linedraw).
    We have added to this Lucida Typewriter, Lucida Typewriter Narrow,
    for a total of 16 fonts.   

    This is partly in response to Adobe now offering two new font sets:
    Lucida Sans Typewriter (406) and Lucida Typewriter (407).

4a	We charge the same for this new enlarged font set.

4b	If someone with `Lucida Sans Typewriter' want it: charge $35 + shipping


(5) We are sending out beta test copies of WIN32 version of DVIWindo.
    All but TIFF image inclusion seems to work.  TIFF image support is 
    the second to last piece missing for release 2.0 of Y&Y TeX System 
    (also need new installation script).

    Note that it will *only* work in Windows 95 and Windows NT.
    We'll keep on offering release 1.2 for Windows 3.1 users
    (but will relabel it 1.3 after 2.0 comes out).

5a	We plan to keep the same prices for new release.

5b	Haven't decided on upgrade price yet.


(6) We are adding additional composite characters to CM text fonts 
    (from 58 => 97).  This covers many Eastern European characters in
    addition to the Western European accented/composite characters.

    We expect to provide the ability to reencode these to `DC font' layout
    (T1 or Cork encoding).  We won't be able to cover all glyphs in Cork, 
    but enough to satisfy most users.

    But this is obviously low priority work...
