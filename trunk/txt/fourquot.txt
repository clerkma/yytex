After those things that are the prime necessities of life, nothing is
more precious than books.  Their creator, the Art of Typography,
renders crucial services and provides unlimited assistance to
society.  It informs the citizen, advances the progress of science
and art, nurtures and cultivates the mind, and elevates the soul: 
its duty is to be the communicator and interpreter of wisdom and truth.
It is, in essence, the depictor of the mind.  Therefore it can truly
be called the art of all arts and the science of all sciences.

Pierre Simon Fournier, Manuel Typographique, 1764
