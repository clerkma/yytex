		Fonts called for in EPS files (epsfonts.txt)
===================================================================

EPS files may include fonts, or may instead use DSC (Document
Structuring Comments) to request fonts.  Adobe Illustrator, for
example, uses DSC comments rather than actually including fonts in
the EPS files. These DSC comments are aimed at a mystical `spooling'
program.  No spooling program gets into the act when DVIPSONE creates
a PS file, so DVIPSONE has to try and accomodate these font requests
itself (most DVI->PS processors do not do this, by the way).

The DSC comments of interest are of the form 

	%%IncludeResource: font ...  or the older style 
	%%IncludeFont: ... 

There are also 

	%%DocumentNeededResource: font ... or the older style
	%%DocumentNeededFonts: ... 

comments, but these are merely informationoal and do not indicate
where to include the fonts (see Appendix G of the PostScript
Reference Manual, 2nd edition).

The font name mentioned in DSC comment is the PS FontName (e.g.
Times-Bold), *not* the name of the corresponding PFB file (e.g.
tir_____.pfb).  Somehow DVIPSONE has to map from the PS FontName 
to the file name.

If DVIPSONE can find an ATM.INI file it tries to use the information
there.  The ATM.INI file relates Windows Face Name and style (e.g.
Times, BOLD) to the file name.  The Windows Face Name is often not
the same as the PS FontName (even taking into account the style
decoration).  What's more, in Windows NT, the fonts may be used
without ATM or with ATM Deluxe 4.0 for NT, which does not use an
ATM.INI file.

To have DVIPSONE obey DSC font inclusion request reliably, one should
create a ATMFONTS.MAP file and put it where DVIPSONE is looking for
PFB font files (typically c:\psfonts or c:\winnt\fonts).  The
ATMFONTS.MAP file contains `key=value' entries, where the `key' is
the PS FontName and the `value' is the PFB file name. For example:

	TektonMM=c:\psfonts\zjrg____.pfb

Printer resident fonts should not be included - even when the EPS file
calls for them using DSC comments.  DVIPSONE consults `standard.sub'
(or another substitution file you ask for using command line flags).
to determine what fonts are printer resident.  The default substitution
file lists the four styles each of Times, Helvetica, and Courier.
You can add to this list if the EPS files calls for other printer
resident fonts and you don't want these included.
