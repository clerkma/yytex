	AMS LaTeX 1.2 and `missing' fonts:
===============================================

The `PostScript' (i.e. Type 1) version of the AMS font set is a subset of
the 89 fonts in the bitmapped version of the AMS font set--- otherwise it
would have been much more expensive than the 75 font CM set, given the much
lower volume of sale (This was a decision reached jointly by BSR and Y&Y in
consultation with AMS).  For example, only the 5, 7, and 10pt sizes of the
Euler fonts are included---the 6, 8 and 9pt sizes are not.  This is not
much of a handicap, since the `odd' sizes are rarely used, and are very
similar in shape to `neighboring' existing sizes.

All AMS macro packages have an option or switch that can be set to tell the
package that one is using the `PS' version of the font set.  For AMS LaTeX
1.2 this is the `psamsfonts' option.  See extract from `amsclass.dtx' below
(You can also use the `noamsfonts' options if you do not have the AMS fonts).

If a DVI file has been produced *without* using the `psamsfonts' option,
it can still be processed by DVIPSONE. DVIPSONE can be asked to substitute
appropriate fonts.  Simply add to the file `standard.sub' lines like

cmex7		cmex10

which tell it to use CMEX10 in place of CMEX7 (suitably scaled *and* with
the metrics of CMEX7).

Similarly, DVIWindo can be asked to substitute appropriate fonts.  Simply add
to the file `dviwindo.fnt' lines like

CMEX10=CMEX7

which tells it use CMEX10 in place of CMEX7 (suitably scaled).

From amsclass.dtx:

% \subsection{Some font options}
%
%    The `noamsfonts' option means to avoid declaring math alphabets or
%    symbol fonts for the extra math fonts in the AMSFonts set. If these
%    fonts are declared, it means that the corresponding \fn{.tfm} files
%    are required even for documents that do not use any symbols from
%    those fonts. So we allow optionally to not declare them, for
%    convenience of users who don't have those fonts on their system and
%    don't want the hassle of getting them.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\mathfrak{needed}
\DeclareOption{noamsfonts}{\let\mathfrak\relax}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    The `psamsfonts' option, passed on the amsfonts package, means that
%    alternative \fn{.fd} files should be used that do not refer to
%    \fn{.tfm} files for sizes 6,8,9 (which are not present in the
%    PostScript AMS fonts set from Y\&Y/Blue Sky Research). This should
%    also trigger the \opt{cmex10} option of \pkg{amsmath}, to avoid
%    trying to load sizes 7--9 of \fn{cmex}.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareOption{psamsfonts}{%
  \PassOptionsToPackage{psamsfonts}{amsfonts}%
  \PassOptionsToPackage{cmex10}{amsmath}}
%    \end{macrocode}
