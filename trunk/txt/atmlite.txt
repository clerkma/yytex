ATM 4.0 Light for Windows NT 4.0, and ATM 4.0 Light for Windows 95
----------------------------------------------------------------

In the ATM folder you will find atmnt4.exe and atm95.exe.
These are self-extracting ZIP archives that will deposit their 
contents in a temporary directory you can choose.  
Pick the appropriate executable for your operating system and run it.  

Let's say you chose c:\temp as a good place for temporary files.
Then the self-extracting archive will unpack itself into either
c:\temp\adobe\utils_nt4 or c:\temp\adobe\utils_95.

At the end of this operation you will be shown a short `readme.wri' file 
(which may also be found in the corresponding sub-folder).  More info in
	c:\temp\adobe\utils_xx\atm_Lite\readme.wri

To actually install ATM 4.0 Lite, run either 
	c:\temp\adobe\utils_nt4\atm_lite\setup.exe or
	c:\temp\adobe\utils_95\atm_lite\install.exe
(That is, use `Start > Run,' and type in those file names).

Documentation on ATM itself exist in Acrobat PDF format in 
	c:\temp\adobe\utils_xx\atm_lite\atm user guide.pdf

For deep technical questions look at either
	c:\temp\adobe\util_nt4\atm_lite\technical reference guide.wri or
	c:\temp\adobe\utils_95\atm_lite\techref.wri

You can delete the files in the temporary directory after installing ATM.
In Windows 95 you may find DELTREE handy for this purpose:
	deltree c:\temp\adobe
while in Windows NT you can you the /s argument:
	del c:\temp\*.* /s
