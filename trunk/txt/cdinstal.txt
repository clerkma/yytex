          Installing the Y&Y TeX System 2.2 from CD-ROM:
========================================================================

Insert the CD in your CD reader.  You should see this file in NotePad
if you have Auto-Insert-Notification turned on (otherwise double click
on the CD icon).  Next, right click on the CD icon in `My Computer.'

NOTE: If you do NOT get a menu listing installation steps, see (*).

(1) Select `Install Fonts in Windows 2000 or XP' -or-
           `Install ATM 4.0 for Windows 95/98 and all fonts' - or -
           `Install ATM 4.0 for Windows NT 4 and all fonts'

* IMPORTANT: Windows 2000 and XP have Type 1 font support built in, 
* so do NOT try to install ATM 4.0 in Windows 2000 or XP!
* If you do like the ATM interface, download the free ATM 4.1

  ATM, if previously installed, can be used to install fonts:
  use `Start > Programs > Adobe > ATM'
  then install the fonts from the `PSFONTS' folder on the CD.
  For convenience, this folder has all fonts gathered in one place.
  Individual font set folders on the CD are:

    Y&Y CM Complete System:             CM, AMS, LatxFont, and TeXPi
    Y&Y MathTime Complete System:       MathTime and MathPlus 
    Y&Y Lucida Bright Complete System:  Lucidabr and Lucidexp
    Y&Y EM System:                      EM and TeXPi.

(2) Select `Install Y&Y TeX System 2.2'  After installing the TeX System
    itself, the installer continues on to install LaTeX and its packages.

NOTE: The above installs plain TeX, AMS TeX, LaTeX 2e, and optionally 2.09.
You can also install LaTeX and/or extra LaTeX packages later by selecting
    `Install LaTeX 2.09 and/or LaTeX 2e SEPARATELY'
Additional LaTeX 2e packages are on the CD in \ctan\latex\contrib\supported
These take an additional 200 Mb to 300Mb, You are asked at the end
of LaTeX installation whether you would like these installed as well.
Detailed documentation in \ctan\info on the CD and \ctan\macros\latex\doc.

(3) READY, GO!   Tutorial, Sample Files and Extra Documentation:

  Try the simple exercise in the Y&Y TeX System Manual, section 2.5, pg 8
  Then check out the `Hello World' sample files in \yandy\texinput.
  Pick the one designed for the fonts you have installed: hello_CM for CM, 
  hello_MT for MathTime, hello_LB for LucidaBright, and hello_EM for EM. 
  Miscellaneous additional documentation may be found in \yandy\misc-doc.

=====================================================================
(*) FALLBACK:  *ONLY* if the right-click pop-up menu does *NOT* appear
=====================================================================

(See reverse side for normal installation instructions using pop-up menu)

IMPORTANT: Do NOT install ATM 4.0 in Windows 2000 or XP.
In Windows 95/98/SE/ME/NT, first, install Adobe Type Manager 4.0 (ATM).

 Install ATM 4.0 --- unless you already have ATM 4.0.  Double click on
 `My Computer', then your CD ROM drive. Double click the `ATM' folder.
 In Windows 95/98, double click `Win95', then double click `install.exe'.
 In Windows NT 4, double click `NT4', then double click `setup.exe' 
 The ATM installer will also install the latest versions of the `Base 13' 
 fonts (Times, Helvetica, Courier, and Symbol) from Adobe, *and* the fonts
 that come with your TeX System.  

 To install ATM alone -- without the fonts -- go into `Win95_NoFonts'
 instead of `Win95', or `NT4_NoFonts' instead of `NT4'. In that case 
 you will need to install the fonts separately.  To do this, launch the 
 ATM control panel from `Start > Programs > Adobe > ATM.'  Click `Add.'  
 Then, in the right hand panel, navigate to a font folder on the CD.
 Select all fonts in that folder (Ctrl-A) and click `Add.'  Depending on 
 which TeX System you have, the fonts will be in the following folders:

    Y&Y CM Complete System:             CM, AMS, LatxFont, TeXPi 
    Y&Y MathTime Complete System:       MathTime and MathPlus 
    Y&Y Lucida Bright Complete System:  Lucidabr and Lucidexp, or
    Y&Y EM System:                      EM and TeXPi.

SECOND, install the Y&Y TeX System:

  From `My Computer' open the CD ROM (if it isn't already open).  Double click
  the `setup' icon on the CD ROM.  Follow the dialog boxes.  If you choose
  `Express' installation you will not be asked a lot of questions.  If you want
  more detailed control, select `Custom'.  If you don't know the answer to some
  question, select the default.  This will yield a useable installation that
  can later be fine-tuned - if needed - by editing the `dviwindo.ini' file.

FINALLY, install LaTeX Support:

  At the end of the TeX System installation you can continue on to the `LaTeX
  Support' installation.  Alternatively, you can exit and do this later by
  double clicking the `setup1' (note the digit `1') on the CD ROM.  Additional
  LaTeX 2e packages may be found on the CD in \ctan\latex\contrib\supported\.
  Detailed documentation in \ctan\info on the CD and \ctan\macros\latex\doc.
