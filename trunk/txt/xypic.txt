XY Pic							(xypic.txt)
-------

XYPIC is a package for drawing certain kinds of diagrams in TeX.
To draw lines of various lengths and orientations it can use:
	(i)   special 'XY' fonts; or 
	(ii)  raw PostScript (for DVIPS); or
	(iii) TPIC \specials.  

The special fonts used by XY Pic are now available in Adobe Type 1 format
(folder xy_fonts on the Y&Y TeX System CD-ROM).  You can also use TPIC
\specials --- which are supported by DVIWindo and DVIPSONE (as well as DVIPS).

(*)  Use the `dvips' and `tpics' option with the XYPIC package.

This forces it to use TPIC \specials do draw lines instead of using 
special XYPIC fonts, or raw PostScript (Note: the `tpic' option is
ignored unless you also specify the `dvips' option).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using fonts other than Computer Modern conflicts can arise
because XYPIC redefines the `quoteleft' character. So:

(*)  If you use \input ansiacce (or \input accents), you need to
     redefine `quoteleft' after loading the XYPIC package.

The XYPIC package makes ` (quoteleft) active --- as does `ansiacce.tex'
This can cause a conflict.  To avoid this, make `quoteleft' an ordinary
character before loading XYPIC and make it active again afterwards.

Also, XYPIC redefines `quoteleft'.  This has to be undone.  Here is what
needs to be done if you use \input ansiacce:

\catcode39=12
\catcode96=12 

\usepackage{xy}

\catcode`\'=\active \chardef'=146  
\catcode`\`=\active \chardef`=145
