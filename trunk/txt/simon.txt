Barry Simon's review says many positive things about the Y&Y TeX System, yet
lacks depth and does not cover many of the power features (see list at end)
of the Y&Y TeX System.  It also includes a few inaccuracies, both about Y&Y
TeX specificially and more generally about fonts and font use in TeX.

The Y&Y TeX System:
-------------------

...

While Y&Y has paid close attention to fonts and other
technical aspects, ironically it still uses `PostScript.'

	This is inverted!  `PostScript' --- or more precisely ATM 
	compatible Adobe Type 1  --- *is* the font technology of choice.
	Hand hinted Type 1 fonts are an expensive alternative to the 
	cheap auto hinted TrueType fonts used by competing systems.

	There are too many advantages to fonts in Type 1 format
	to go over here, just to say that TrueType fonts (i) do not work 
	well in Acrobat PDF documents, (ii) cannot be reencoded on the fly,
	(iii) are not accepted by many service bureaus, and (iv) do not
	render well on screen when compared with well hinted Type 1 fonts.  

Hand-hinted fonts can look subtly better, but the people I showed couldn't
see much difference between Y&Y hand-hinted PostScript fonts and a TrueType
version of the same typeface that comes with PC TeX - at least not from
a 600 dpi printer.

	True!  At medium to high resolution (600 dpi or more) the
	difference is not great (unless the underlying outlines are
	inaccurate).  The key issue is on-screen rendering quality 
	(i.e. at 96 or 120 dpi).  And here well hinted Type 1 fonts shine.
	TeX documents can created entirely without need for printing if 
	the screen preview is of high enough quality.  Lets save some trees! 

	A potential confusing factor in comparing font quality is the
	following:  If you have TrueType and Type 1 fonts with the same name 
	installed, then you will not be able to tell the difference, since
	Windows will arbitrarily chose one or the other (independent of 
	which TeX system you are running).  To judge on-screen rendering
	quality you first have to completely remove the TrueType fonts.

Although Y&Y shines on the technical underpinnings, its usability
is sometimes lacking. It desperately needs a good setup program 
instead of forcing you to separately install multiple modules ---

	True.  The older installation scheme provided more flexibility 
	in controlling what components get installed, but based on user
	feedback, the installation program for the new 32 bit system
	(release 2.0) is unified and simplified (and this will be carried
	forward into a planned 16 bit system release 1.3).

The on-line help is limited compared to the printed documentation
and isn't in Windows help format.

	We consider it a *feature* that it is not in Windows help format!
	It demonstrates the ability of Y&Y TeX itself to support hyper-text,
	color and text search (not possible in Windows Help format). 

	And yes, the on line help is less extensive than the documentation,
	but that is simply a reflection of the fact that Y&Y documentation
	has enormous technical depth compared to our competitors.  
	(The Help file is not the place, for example, to discuss work-arounds
	for bugs in EPS files made by other applications).  And
	the Help file *does* address all issues arising when using the
	previewer, customizing the TeX meni, and calling TeX or an editor.

The program lacks PC TeX's smarts in tracking file names.

	It *does* have a `Most Recently Used List' ability --- although 
	this can be turned off.  So this must have been the result of n
	inadvertend configuration choice (The dviwindo.ini file should have 
	a [Documents] section listing at least one DVI file for the MRU list
	to appear.

...

PC TeX:
-------

...

if you compile a TeX source file called `foobar.tex,' thereby making a
`foobar.dvi' file, when you hit the button to view the DVI file, the open
dialog will already have `foobar.dvi' filled in.

	The same is true in Y&Y TeX --- only even better!  When you first 
	TeX a source file and then click `Preview' (from the TeX menu) it
	will automatically open the corresponding DVI file --- no need to
	navigate the `Open File' dialog!  See `mouse tricks' in the Help file.

	What's more, once you have created a particular DVI file you can open
	that file in the previewer and never have to go back to any `Open
	File' dialog --- when TeX or the editor are called, the previewer will
	pass along the correct source file name automatically.

	What is more, you do not have to close the previewer while running
	TeX (unlike PC TeX) so there is no need to ever load the DVI file
	into the previewer again!  Which also means that your page
	number, page magnification and view position are maintained.

	It's a different way to operate --- and a lot easier. As in
	Textures, you simply keep the preview open in one window and the
	source code open in another (the ASCII text editor) window.

Conclusion

...

I must confess some disappointment with these products because I feel 
they haven't tried to deal aggressively with TeX's limitations.
Each product suffers from a phletora of fonts requiring installation
of from 100 to 200 separate font files.  While the fonts are scalable outline
fonts, TeX traditionally uses separate fonts for separate point sizes.

	(1) If you use either `Lucida Bright + Lucida New Math' or
	`MathTime + Times-Roman' fonts, you do not need many fonts files
	(16 in the case of MathTime + Times-Roman), since these font sets are
	designed to be used with linear scaling. 
	Only a relatively small number of font files is needed --- 
	even though the Lucida New Math and Lucida Bright Expert font sets
	include the most extensive collection of math glyphs of any font
	family --- with several hundred distinct mathematical operators,
	relations, symbols, and delimiters --- in several styles.

	(2) In the case of Computer Modern, there is a typographical quality
	reason for this phletora of fonts: optical scaling.  In traditional 
	typography, different font sizes where *not* merely linearly scaled
	versions of the same shape, but were adjusted to look good at their
	particular size, taking into account the optical properties of the
	human visual system.  This subtley has largely been lost when desktop
	publishing came on the scene, but has been preserved in the Type 1
	versions of the Computer Modern fonts (Optical scaling now makes a
	comeback in some Multiple Master fonts).

	(3) These days few worry about the disk space taken by a hundred
	font files, but the clutter of the font menus *is* in fact a concern.
	The Y&Y TeX System is one of only a half dozen applications that
	support a new feature of ATM 4.0:  auto activation of fonts.
	In ATM 4.0, fonts can be grouped and individual groups made `active'
	or `inactive'.  Inactive fonts do not appear in font menus, but
	the Y&Y TeX System can still use them.

I regret there's no PC prograsm that does what Textures does on the Mac:
incremental compile TeX source as you enter it, showing you the output, 
in real time, in the previewer.

	While the Y&Y TeX System does not have Texture's `flash mode,'
	it comes the closest to this of all other TeX systems.
	As explained above, the preferred mode of operation is to 
	keep the preview open in one window, while the source code
	appears in the editor in another window. It takes just three
	key strokes (Ctrl-S, Alt-Tab, F5) to save the file, switch 
	attention to the preview window and TeX the source file.
	On a short document the edit-TeX-preview cycle takes perhaps
	two seconds before the new typeset result replaces the old.

	Compared to `flash' mode, this has the advantage that there are 
	no `hiccups' that slow down the editor screen update while TeX is
	stealing cycles to process the TeX source file in the background.

Engineering and Science on the Web' Design Engineering, March/April 1996)

	Given the rapid changes on the web, this is now a bit dated.
	You may want to look at http://www.YandY.com/pdf_from.pdf

Short list of unique power features of Y&Y TeX System not mentioned:
====================================================================

(1) Provides access to *all* characters in a font (on-the-fly font reencoding)
    (Other TeX systems cannot access fi fl dotlessi dotaccent etc.);
  
(2) Fast printing to PostScript devices (partial font downloading)
    (Speeds printing by factor of four to eight on short jobs);

(3) Handle arbitrarily complex TeX jobs (dynamic memory allocation)
    (No more `TeX capacity exceeded messages);

(4) Support for Acrobat PDF file creation, including hyper-text links
    (automatic translation of hyper-text links to pdfmarks and more);

(5) Support for TIFF image insertion (preferred format for images);

(6) Support for WMF image insertion, and WMF previews in EPSF files;

(7) Transfer of TeX typeset material on clipboard (and it's *not* a bitmap);

(8) Text search in DVI file (even text with f-ligatures);

(9) Make your own font `instances' (support for Multiple Master fonts);

(10) Fully page-independent, resolution-independent PostScript output ---
     ready for page imposition, color separation and direct-to-plate;

(11) Inclusion of fonts called for by %%IncludeFont in inserted EPS files
     (with other systems these are replaced with Courier);

(12) Device independent graphics using standard TPIC \specials; 

(13) Easy font name aliasing to deal with non-standard font naming schemes
     (important since TeX font names are not standardized);

(14) Extensive support for `foreign' language keyboards
     (get proper hyphenation in languages with accented characters);

etc. etc. --- all of which make Y&Y TeX a `must have' for publishers, 
service bureaus, TeX consultants, as well as authors, faculty and students.
