Dr. Donald P. Story's DVIWindo Help File:
=========================================

Dr. Donald P. Story of the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio, has kindly
provided us with a handy help file for DVIWindo, exploiting DVIWindo's own
hyper-text capability.  To use it, simple open `dvi_help.dvi' in DVIWindo.

Words in green are hyper-text buttons.  Clicking on a `button' leads you to
the corresponding `mark,' where a more detailed explanation of that item may
be found. To return to where you came from, use the right mouse button.  The
hyper-text facility has a push-down stack for jumps and you can return from
several levels down using the right mouse button.  If you get lost, just
press the `Home' key to return to the `home page.'

You may want to adjust the page position and scale so that text is
conveniently positioned on the screen before you start.  Then select 
`Store New Page Scale' to make the change permanent.

It is convenient to add a `TeX Menu' item that links to the help file.  Add 
a line like the following to the [Applications] section of dviwindo.ini.

	Help|F1=dviwindo c:\dviwindo\dvi_help

It may also be convenient to create an icon for the DVIWindo help file.  
First click on your `Y & Y' program group to select it.  Then pick `New' 
from  Progam Manager's `File' menu.  Select `Program Item'.  For 
`Description,' fill in `DVIWindo Help'.  For `Command Line,' enter 

	`c:\dviwindo\dviwindo.exe c:\dviwindo\dvi_help.dvi'

(You may have to adjust the directories for your particular installation).

The DVIWindo help file has been set up to use the TrueType fonts that come
with Windows 3.1 (Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman, Symbol).  So you must
have TrueType fonts enabled for this to work properly.
