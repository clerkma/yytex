NEW: third diskette added to the FMP:
-------------------------------------

On this third Font Manipulation Diskette you will find 32 bit versions
of some of the utilities, which menas they will handle long file names
better, and also have fewer limitations on allocations and array sizes.

You will also find here the new BINtoHEX and HEXtoBIN utilities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
New easy way to move MacBinary files from Mac to PC and vice versa:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Transport the files in BinHeX format on a diskette or direct link
or via email.  But wait:  you've tried that and it didn't work!
Well that is because BinHeX conversion routines on the PC side 
are too stupid to do it right.  This includes Eudora for Windows,
and the public domain `binhex.exe' DOS program from the University
of Minnesota.  These both work properly only for undifferentiated plain 
text or binary files, not MacBinary files.  They do not recognize or
translate the MacBinary header, treating it just as another part of
the file.

Use BINtoHEX.exe and HEXtoBIN.exe from the FMP instead.  These can
also handle plain text or binary files, but that is not their real
purpose in life.  They handle MacBinary files correctly --- constructing 
the correct BinHeX header from the MacBinary header and vice versa.

So after creating a MacBinary file using PFBtoMAC or AFMtoSCR, pump
it through BINtoHEX to create an .hqx file.  Send this in email to the
Mac, or put it on a PC diskette and read it on the Mac using Apple's
Macintosh PC Exchange.  Then run it through BinHex 4.0 on the Mac
(Download->Application).

Conversely, run your font files through BinHex 4.0 on the Mac
(Application->Download) and email the .hqx file created, or put
it on a PC diskette using Apple's Macintosh PC Exchange. Then
pass the file through HEXtoBIN on the IBM PC side to reconstruct
a MacBinary file, ready for MACtoPFA or SCRtoAFM.

Fixing TrueType fonts incorrectly marked as being `text' fonts
--------------------------------------------------------------

`Text' fonts are fonts intended to be reencoded to platform specific
encoding.  Math, Pi, Symbol and Decorative fonts typical should not
be treated as `text' fonts since they are to be used with a fixed
character layout.  Unfortunately `font monging' software mostly does
not do well when it comes to `non text' fonts.  So there are TTF
files floating around for non text fonts that are marked incorrectly.
The MKNONTXT utility rewrites some of the tables in the TTF file to 
make it appear as a non-text font to the TrueType rasterizer.
