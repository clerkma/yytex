LATE BREAKING NEWS (file: news.txt last updated 99/Nov/1):

(1) Windows 2000 Professional (W2K) now supported.

	Add IgnoreBadInstall=1 to [Window] section of dviwindo.ini
	if you have Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) font support installed.

(2) You can now link back from DVIWindo to the editor.

    Double click on text in the preview.   See editlink.txt for details

(3) ATM 4.0 for 95/98 and ATM 4.0 for NT included with Y&Y TeX Systems

    Easy, high quality support for Type 1 fonts in both 95/98 and NT.

(4) Y&Y TeX System now can reencode TrueType text fonts in Windows NT!

    You are no longer constrained to use Windows ANSI encoding for text in NT.
    Did you know that Arial, Times New Roman etc. have fi and fl ligatures?

(5) Y&Y TeX System now can reencode Type 1 text fonts with ATM for Windows NT! 

    We have `adjusted' the Y&Y System TeX to make proper use of ATM 4.0 for NT.  
    It  will properly reencode Type 1 fonts. (Ignore the benign error log
    in dviwindo.ini about not being able to connect to ATM).

(6) Rotated and scaled material is shown on screen in Windows NT.

    A new set of device independent \specials are supported by the 
    Y&Y TeX System for rotating, scaling and arbitrary linear transformation
    of text, rules, TPIC \special graphics, and TIFF images
    (see ctm.txt).  You'll be able to see landscape tables on screen!

    In addition, a selected number of PostScript \specials used
    in the past for rotation and scaling (such as those emitted 
    by the LateX 2e graphics package) are `mapped' to the new
    method and hence will work without changes to the source file.

(7) The PostScript printer driver now can compress TIFF images in PS output.

    The Y&Y TeX System supports TIFF image insertion.  For images
    (rectangular arrays of color or gray values) --- as opposed to 
    other kinds of graphics like line drawings --- TIFF is the preferred
    format (much more compact than EPS e.g.).   Y&Y TeX already supported
    most compression methods provided for by the TIFF spec on *input*.
    Now - if you have a PS level 2 printer - you can also have compression
    of PostScript output using the -*L command line flag with DVIPSONE.
    This can dramatically reduce PS file size if you have large images.

    If you have a PS level 2 printer, add the -*L command line option 
    using `Preferences > Command Line > DVIPSONE' in DVIWindo.

(8) BMP images are supported just like TIFF using \special{insertimage: ...}
