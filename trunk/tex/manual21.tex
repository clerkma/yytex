\section{Introduction}
%
% Need a more general introduction --- provide more context?
% Why has user bought the package ---  what does (s)he expect?
%
\TeX\ --- invented by Donald E. Knuth of Stanford University ---
is the premiere tool for typesetting % of 
technical material.
\TeX\ excels at displaying mathematic formulae and also 
features an outstanding paragraph % hyphenation-justification
line-breaking algorithm.
\TeX\ is a `code based' system, that is, 
the source file you create is marked up using `control sequences,'
and has to be processed by the {\TeX} `compiler' % processor
before it is possible to view the typeset result 
on screen or on the printed page.

Since \TeX\ is not {\sc wysiwyg} (or {\sc wysiayg} --- 
What You See Is All You Get), \TeX\ depends on %  \yandytex\ system uses
an edit--\TeX--preview cycle to produce the desired results. 
First, you create or edit a % plain {\ASCII}
text source file in a text editor or word processor. 
Second, you `run \TeX' on the file, % with \yandytex.
which creates a compact binary file with extension €.dvi€
(for `DeVice Independent').
Third, you view the resulting €.dvi€ 
file using the previewer. % {\DVIWindo}.
If the results are not satisfactory, you go back to step one.
Once you are satisfied with the results, you go to a fourth step: 
Printing your masterpiece of fine typography.

%% emphasize speed ?

The \yandytex\ System release~2.1
is an implementation of {\TeX} for IBM PC compatibles
% running Windows~3.1, Windows NT~3.51, Windows~95, or OS~2/2.1.  
running Windows~95/98 or Windows~NT 4.0 (or later).  
It provides many advanced features such as 
on the fly font reencoding, 
dynamic memory allocation, 
partial font downloading,
hypertext linkage, % added 1996/July/23
and multiple master font support. % added 1999/July/26
The \yandytex\ System comes with commercial grade fonts in 
industry standard {\ATM} compatible Adobe Type~1 format
(a.k.a. `Post\-Script' fonts),
but can also work with TrueType fonts.

The \yandytex\ System is, like Gaul, divided into three main parts:

\nlist
\item {\DVIWindo}: a previewer and printer driver for \TeX\ {\tt.dvi} files.
This is the heart of the system --- everything % else 
is controlled from here.

\item {\DVIPSONE}: a device driver that converts \TeX\ {\tt.dvi} files 
to resolution independent, DSC-compliant, 
page-independent Post\-Script (PS)
files suitable for printing on any Adobe Post\-Script % PS
device.

\item \yandytex\ itself: a 32-bit implementation of \TeX\ that can run
as a `console application' in Windows~95/98 and Windows~NT. % 95/Sep/27
% for {\DOS}, {\DOS} boxes under Windows, and as a
% `console application' in Windows NT.
% and in a {\DOS} box under Windows 3.1. % rephrased 96/July/23

\endlist

\noindent
The \yandytex\ System includes
Adobe Type Manager (\ATM) 4.0 for rasterizing
fonts in Adobe Type~1 format, 
% the Programmer's File Editor, {\PFE},
the WinEdt editor,
and some handy utilities. %  programs
% shareware ? CTAN ?
In addition, the \yandytex\ System CD holds many useful 
{\LaTeXe} packages from CTAN (Comprehensive TeX Archive Network),
extra documentation, 
as well as handy shareware programs.

This manual explains how to install the system, % programs, 
gives brief instructions on how to use it, and gives hints on how to
trouble-shoot the most common % Windows-related
problems.  

This manual does {\it not\/} explain how to use \TeX\ 
or Post\-Script --- or how to program in \TeX\ or Post\-Script.

\section{Installation}

There are two parts to the installation:
(i) installing {\ATM} and the fonts (do this first), and 
(ii) installing the {\yandy} TeX System itself.
% We'll discuss {\ATM} installation first, since {\ATM} should be installed
% first --- except on Windows~2000.
% it is best to install the fonts before the \yandytex\ System itself.
%
%% systems with {\ATM}.
%
% On `{\ATM} compatible' systems 
% (i.e. systems for which {\ATM} is currently available),
On Windows~95/98 and Windows~NT 4.0, you must install Adobe Type Manager ({\ATM}).
{\ATM} rasterizes the fonts for on screen display as well 
as when printing to non-PS devices.
On Windows~2000, the Type~1 font rasterizer is built in,
and Type~1 fonts can be installed by dragging them to the €fonts€ folder.

%
% You may, however, still wish to install {\ATM} for its font management functions.
%
% Install ATM~4.0 for NT if you have it.
% --- unless you are using a version of Windows~NT 
% for which no {\ATM} is yet available.
% Then

To install {\ATM}, right click on the {\CD} icon and select 
from the menu % that appears
the version of {\ATM} appropriate to your operating system.
%
If you elect to install {\ATM} {\it without\/} fonts, then you 
will later need to install the fonts supplied with your 
\yandytex\ system from the {\ATM} control panel (see section~2.1).

% Consult the documentation that comes with the \MathTime\ fonts
% for additional details, if necessary.

% Note that with large font sets (such as Computer Modern or

\subsect{Installing Fonts with ATM}

% On Windows~95/98 start by installing {\ATM}.
% On Windows~NT install {\ATM} if you have {\ATM}~4.0 for NT.
Start by installing {\ATM} from the CD.
Choose the version appropriate to your version of Windows.
% In either case, insert the {\ATM} diskette or CD, 
% and  type €a:install€ from the `Start{\down}Run' dialog.
% {\ATM} only exists for new shell...
% (or `File{\down}Run' dialog in the Program Manager in Windows~NT). NO
% Refer to `Installing {\ATM}' in the {\ATM} manual if necessary.
This step normally {\it also\/} installs the fonts that came 
with your system. 

% Adobe currently supplies us with {\ATM} version~3.01 for use with Windows~95
% You need at {\it least\/} {\ATM} version~3.02 
% for everything to work as advertised in Windows~95/98.
% and ATM~4.0 for NT when using Windows~NT.
% If you use {\sc pcl} printers in Windows~95, 
% you need the latest printer drivers, 
% since the original Windows {\sc pcl} drivers are buggy.
% (An upgrade from {\ATM}~3.0 and {\ATM}~3.01 to version 3.02 
% is included in the €\util€ subfolder ---
% unzip the file €atm302up.zip€ using €pkunzip.exe€).
% (Free upgrades from {\ATM}~3.0 and {\ATM}~3.01 to version 3.02 
% are available at €http://www.adobe.com€).

% For Windows~NT 4.0 you can use {\ATM}~4.0 for NT if you have it --- 
% For Windows~NT 4.0 you can use {\ATM}~4.0 for NT (recommended) ===
% or you can use the automatic conversion to TrueType format
% described in the next section. % section~2.2

If you installed {\ATM} {\it without\/} installing fonts, 
you can selectively install fonts later.  
% Once you have {\ATM} installed, 
Start up the {\ATM} control panel --- from the `Start' button select 
% `Programs{\down}Main{\down}ATM' (ATM~3.02) or
`Programs{\down}Adobe{\down}Adobe Type Manager.' % (ATM~4.0).

Click on `Add' or `Add Fonts.' 
Then choose the drive with the CD
% (in {\ATM} 3.02, look for a list of drives --- €[-a-]€ etc. 
% --- near the bottom of the list of folders), 
Select each of the folders with the fonts in turn.
The names of these folders are:

% In Windows NT~3.51, install instead using the `File{\down}Run' 
% dialog box in Program Manager.

% Similarly, we'll assume you are installing the system on Windows~95 and hence

% On other operating systems please adjust the instructions as described above.

% The €setup€ installation program first 
The program first

and {\AMS}-{\TeX} formats.
At the end of this operation you are given the option to also 
install {\LaTeXe} and/or {\LaTeX} 2.09.
You can install {\LaTeX} at this point or 
do this latter
% These two formats can alternatively be installed later by

% then it will also refer to the three `{\LaTeX} Support' diskettes.
% The `{\LaTeX} Support' diskettes can be installed 
% separately at a later time, by the way.

You can choose which system components to install. 
% You may, for example, wish to omit {\DVIPSONE}, the Post\-Script printer driver, 
% if you will never need Post\-Script output.
We recommend that you accept the defaults.
By the way, do {\it not\/} attempt to install into a folder that has
spaces in  its path name --- {\TeX} itself does not 
like file names with spaces!

If you like your current text editor or word processor
then you can link it into the `TeX' menu in {\DVIWindo}, 
as explained in section~3.4.2. % explicit section ?
%
But the \yandytex\ System does include a full featured 
Windows editor of its own --- 
% developed by Alan Phillips --- called {\PFE}.
WinEdt --- developed by Aleksander Simonic.
The editor will be installed in the €WinEdt€ subfolder of the 
main €\yandy€ folder.
% The {\PFE} editor 
The editor comes with its own `help' file explaining 
its operation ---  just hit the F1 function key to access it
while in the editor. % while in {\PFE}.

% We also include {\PFE}

Note that you can always add system components later.
Also, most choices made during installation can be
modified from the `Preferences' menu in the {\DVIWindo} 
previewer (or by editing the \yandytex\ configuration file 
€dviwindo.ini€ in the €windows€ or €winnt€ folder % directory 
using a plain ASCII text editor 
--- such as `Notepad,' `WordPad,' `WinEdt' or {\PFE}).
% (in `Start{\down}Programs{\down}Accessories')

We'll discuss next the questions that you will be asked % come up 
during installation.
We recommend that you normally accept the default choices,
unless there is some good reason not to do so.

\subsub{Questions and Answers during Installation.}
% TeX System Customization
%
You can chose between `Custom' and `Express' installation.
If you chose `Express' installation, you will not be 
asked a lot of questions and the defaults will be used.
Otherwise read on.

When asked what font encoding (character layout) to use for text
fonts, accept the default {\TEXNANSI} 
(€texnansi€, also referred to as LY1 in {\LaTeX}) --- 
unless you are % both a \TeX pert and 
a `fontspert' and want to experiment.
The chosen encoding will be used for all {\it text\/} fonts.
% or you do not have {\ATM} installed.
% If you are running on Windows ~NT {\it without\/} {\ATM}, 
% select `Windows ANSI' encoding instead.
% This is required because TrueType fonts {\it cannot\/} be reencoded 
% `on the fly' --- the way {\DVIWindo} reencodes Type~1 fonts ---
% and Windows insists on encoding text fonts as Windows ANSI.

You will be asked where {\TeX} source files may be found.
Now, you can, of course, run {\TeX} on files in {\it any\/} folder,
by giving their full path, but it can be % is often 
convenient to give just a file name {\it without\/} 
the path in €\input€ and €\usepackage€ macros.
The installation already adds folders % the folders % directories 
with the {\LaTeXe} class files, and {\LaTeX} 2.09 style files,
so you need not be concerned about those.
During installation you are given 
% This just gives you 
an opportunity to enter {\it additional\/} folders. % directories.
Give the full path of each folder % directory 
that you plan to use for % {\TeX} 
style files --- % and source files ---  
hit \ang{Enter} after each one.

When you are done, click `No' when asked:  
`Specify another directory?'.
Note that you can  easily change this list of folders % directory list 
later by modifying the €TEXINPUTS€ environment variable 
from {\DVIWindo}'s `Preferences{\down}Environment Variables'
menu (or by editing the €dviwindo.ini€ file).
Actually, unless you are running {\TeX} 
{\it without\/} a format preloaded,
you should modify the `format specific' variables 
€PLAIN€ for plain {\TeX}, €AMSTEX€ for {\AMS}-{\TeX},
€LPLAIN€ for {\LaTeX} 2.09, or €LATEX€ for {\LaTeXe}
--- see section~3.2.1).

Similarly, you will be asked where your graphics and image files
({\EPS}, {\TIFF}, {\BMP} and {\WMF}) %  (if any)
are to be searched for.
Navigate to or type in the full path of each folder. % directory.

When you are done,  click `No' when asked:  `Specify another directory?'.
This list can be changed easily later by modifying the
€PSPATH€ environment variable from the 
{\DVIWindo}'s `Preferences{\down}Environment Variables' menu.
%  (or by editing the €dviwindo.ini€ file)
%
Note that if you want {\TeX} to be able to read the `bounding box'
in your EPS files then the folders %  directories 
with those files need to be on the list searched by {\TeX} 
or {\LaTeX} {\it also\/}.
% The installation program automatically takes care of this.
%
% If you add additional folders later you will have to do this manually.

You will be asked whether you have {\TeX} font metric (€.tfm€)
files in another folder % directory 
that you would like to use with the system.
Typically the answer is `No.'
This list can be changed later by modifying the
€TEXFONTS€ environment variable % in €dviwindo.ini€
from {\DVIWindo}'s `Preferences{\down}Environment Variables'
menu. %  (or by editing the €dviwindo.ini€ file)
(Actually % unless you are running {\TeX} without a format preloaded,
--- as explained above ---
you should modify the `format specific' variables

You will also be asked whether \yandytex\ should write €.dvi€ files
in the same folder as the \TeX\ source file, 
or instead into a {\it common\/} working folder. % directory.
{\TeX} users seem to be divided % about equally 
as to which of the two modes of operation they prefer.
%% Send in your vote!  Win a free vacation to Hawaii!
If you can't decide, chose {\it not\/} to use a common 
working folder
(so that the output files will be written back into the 
same place the source files came from).

Here is the difference:
If you run \TeX\ on €c:\books\chapter1.tex€ and chose the former
(i.e. {\it no\/} common working folder)
then the €.dvi€ file will be €c:\books\chapter1.dvi€. 
If you chose instead to have a common working folder % directory 
called, let's say, €c:\working€, then the €.dvi€ file corresponding to
€c:\books\chapter1.tex€ will % instead 
be €c:\working\chapter1.dvi€.

An advantage of a common folder % directory
is that it is easy to clean up and delete old €.dvi€ files. % later.
% optional ?
A disadvantage is that files for different jobs will be mixed up
in one place.
The common working folder can be a folder on your hard drive
(which is created by the installation program if it doesn't already exist), 
or it can be on a {\RAM} drive 
% (well, at least in Windows~95/98).
(Windows~95/98).
%
% Is it impossible to have RAM drive in NT
%
% Files on a {\RAM} drive disappear when you power down your machine.
% (use {\sc dos help} to find out what parameters to use when
% you load €ramdrive.sys€ in your €config.sys€ file).

%% No RAM drives in Windows NT ???
%% No DOS Help in Windows 95 ???

If you forget which mode you chose, you can easily get frustrated,
because you won't know where your €.dvi€ files are going to!
One side effect of this may be that your preview will not
be updated when you re-{\TeX} a file ---
since you may be looking at a ``stale'' version in the
wrong folder, rather than the fresh version just created.
In this case just see whether % or not 
% `Fonts{\down}Working Directory' is checked in {\DVIWindo}.

% You can temporarily change this selection by checking or unchecking

This section walks you through creation of a simple {\TeX} source file
in the text editor, `compilation' of that file using {\TeX}, 
and finally viewing the typeset result on screen. % in {\DVIWindo}.

If you did not already do so during installation, this may be 
a good time to create a folder % directory 
for `random' {\TeX} source files.
% such as the one to be typed in and edited in this exercise.
{\TeX} can, of course, read source files from any folder, % directory,
but a common folder % directory 
for `miscellaneous' {\TeX} source files
can make it easier for you to find them again later.
%
You can create a new folder % directory 
using the Windows Explorer, % (in systems with the new shell),
or from `My Computer' using `File{\down}New{\down}Folder.'
% or the File Manager (in systems without).
% --- or even from the {\DOS} prompt using €mkdir€.
For concreteness, let us suppose this new folder is
called €c:\texinput€.

%%% is this name used again later ???

% Now we are ready for a simple \TeX exercise.
Now we are ready for a simple \TeX ercise.
Launch {\DVIWindo} by double-clicking on the {\DVIWindo} icon
on the desktop 
(or by selecting it from `Start{\down}Programs{\down}YandY21').
% => installation program YANDY20 ???
% from the % `Y and Y' 
% `{\sc YANDY2x}' % ???
% `{\sc YANDY2}' % ???
% program group reached via % from 
% `Start{\down}Programs.'
% Start > Programs > YandY2x > DVIWINDO_2x
You might want to resize {\DVIWindo}'s window at this point 
by dragging the right window frame to the left a bit.
This will make it easier to switch between different windows
just by clicking on an exposed part of a window.

% Select `TeX{\down}PFE Editor' to call the {\PFE} editor.
Select `TeX{\down}WinEdt' to call the editor.
You will be presented with a File Open dialog box.
The first time you do this, enter an exclamation mark (!) for `File Name' 
to tell the system that you do {\it not\/} wish to open an existing file.
% --- instead asking it to create a new file.
Click `OK.'  
The editor comes up. % The {\PFE} editor comes up.
If it covers the full screen, change it to windowed mode by
clicking on the double rectangle icon in the top right corner.
Select `File{\down}New.'  A new window % labelled `Untitled1' 
appears.

%%%%%%%%%%%% editor changed !!!

At this point, you may want to resize the overall % {\PFE} 
editor  window to cover less of the screen.
% (drag the right and bottom edges closer to the edges 
% of the `Untitled1' window).
Then click on the editor window % labelled `Untitled1' 
and type something like `€Hello World!€,' 
followed by `€\end€'.
That is all you need if you are using Computer Modern fonts.

If you are using Lucida Bright fonts % or \MathTime\ fonts, 
insert `€\input lcdplain€' at the beginning of the file.
% respectively 
If you are using \MathTime\ fonts insert instead `€\input mtplain€.
% (or `€\input mtplainx€' if you also have the \MathTime\ Plus fonts).
%
Next, if you are using {\TEXNANSI} (LY1) encoding 
with non-CM fonts % then 
add `€\input texnansi€' % after the above.
(If you are using Windows {\ANSI} encoding % then 
add `€\input ansiacce€' instead).

Finally, select `File{\down}Save.'  
You will be presented with a `File Save' dialog. % box.
Navigate to the folder % directory 
that you wish to use for {\TeX} input files
(perhaps €c:\texinput€),
enter {\tt hello.tex} for the File Name, and click `OK'.

Now that the file has been saved, click on {\DVIWindo}'s window 
to give it the input focus again. Select `TeX{\down}plain TeX'.
Use the File Open dialog box that appears to
select the file that you have just saved.
\yandytex\ will run in a window that disappears when it finishes
(unless there was an error).
Now select `TeX{\down}Preview' to see the typeset result.
(If you don't see it right away, try `File{\down}Default Scale').
You can also open the DVI file directly from `File{\down}Open.'

At this point click on the % {\PFE} 
editor window to get its attention again,
and add €$z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$€
just before the €\end€.
This time type Ctrl+S to save the modified file.
Then type \ang{Alt-Tab} to return input focus to {\DVIWindo}'s window,
% click on {\DVIWindo}'s window again (or 
and use the F5 function key to call plain {\TeX}.
The preview will be automatically refreshed
when {\TeX} has finished producing €hello.dvi€ from €hello.tex€.

You will notice how once you get going, there 
is little need to interact with % File Open
dialog boxes.
Also, most things in the editor can be accomplished using 
the tool bar instead of the pull down menus.
And judicious use of `hot keys' % in {\DVIWindo} 
can speed up the edit-{\TeX}-preview cycle.
%
In the above, it took just three key strokes 
(Ctrl+S, \ang{Alt-Tab}, F5),
to refresh the preview after making changes in the {\TeX} source file.
%
\yandytex\ is so fast that you can get almost 
instantaneous screen updates on short source files.
% (such as this manual).

There are some sample `Hello World' test files already set up for
you to look at in the `texinput' subfolder of your `yandy' folder.
Look for `€Hello_CM€,' `€Hello_LB€,' `€Hello_MT€,' or `€Hello_EM€' ---
the last two letters in the name denote the font set for which 
the file is designed.  You will find both `source' files 
(extension €.tex€) and corresponding €.dvi€ files.  
These sample files are set up for {\LaTeXe}.

You can open the €.dvi€ files from `File{\down}Open'.
The corresponding source files can be opened with the editor from
the `TeX Menu' as described in the next section.

% \section{Using the \yandytex\ System}
\section{Using the \yandytexBold\ System}
%
% This section focuses on the `edit--{\TeX}--preview' cycle alluded to
% in the introduction. % earlier.
The heart of the system is {\DVIWindo}, the previewer.
Your editor, {\TeX} itself, the printer drivers, and other programs
are all called from here. % the previewer. % 's `TeX' menu.

You call {\TeX} or {\LaTeX} from {\DVIWindo}'s `TeX' menu.
Installation sets up `hot keys' that make this particularly easy ---
just press 
F5 for plain {\TeX}, 
F6 for {\AMS} {\TeX},
F7 for {\LaTeX}~2.09, and
F8 for {\LaTeXe}.
The hot keys are listed in the menu itself for easy reference ---
and of course, you can customize them --- as explained later.

Note that you do not need to close the preview when you call {\TeX}.
The preview is automatically refreshed when {\DVIWindo} notices 
that the €.dvi€ file has been `re-compiled.'

The editor is also called from {\DVIWindo}'s `TeX' menu.
Installation sets up convenient hot keys. % for the {\PFE} editor ---
Just press F9, and % {\PFE} 
the editor will pop up with the {\TeX} source file
corresponding to the  €.dvi€ file % currently 
currently being viewed (see section~3.3.2 % customizing the `TeX' menu 
on how to link in your own editor instead). %% section?

Of course, when you start, you may not be viewing a €.dvi€ file.
In this case you will be presented instead with a `File Open' dialog box 
so that you can select a {\TeX} source file for the editor to open.
%
Initially, you may not have a source file to open.
If you want to start on a fresh file, just enter % ! (exclamation mark)
an exclamation mark (!) instead of a file name.

% some repetition of material in Tutorial ?

% or `nul'

If you are viewing a €.dvi€ file and want to edit a file 
{\it other\/} than the corresponding source file, 
% If you want instead to select a different file, 
then hold down the `Shift' key while calling the editor --- 
the `File Open' dialog will pop up.
%
After editing the file and running {\TeX}, use `Tex{\down}Preview' 
to view the corresponding €.dvi€ file.
You won't need to use `Tex{\down}Preview' % once you get going, 
later on, since the previewer will already be 
`connected' to the appropriate €.dvi€ file.

% You may print either from the `File{\down}Print' dialog box or directly
% from the {\DOS} command line.

You print from the `File{\down}Print' dialog box in {\DVIWindo}.  
% If you have installed {\DVIPSONE}, then you can check the

or the €readme.txt€ file 
in the corresponding application folder
(i.e. the €\yandytex€ and €\dvipsone€ subfolders) --- % directory ---
these each give a list of command line options.

You can add command line option passed to these programs when
they  are called from {\DVIWindo} using `Preferences{\down}Command Line.'

\subsect{The Edit--\TeX--Preview Cycle}
%
% The following sections expand on the elements of this process.
% The following expands on the edit--\TeX--preview cycle in \yandytex.
This section focuses on the `edit--{\TeX}--preview' cycle alluded to
earlier. %  introduction. %

If your monitor has enough screen resolution, you % most likely
will find that the most efficient way to operate is to use overlapping
--- or side-by-side --- windows.
% (as opposed to running every application full screen).
If both {\DVIWindo} and the editor window are visible, then you can 
switch between them simply by clicking on a visible part % corner 
of the window that you would like next to receive the input focus. 
%
(By the way, for high quality display, it is a good idea to use 
as high a screen resolution as your video board supports.  
You can control the screen resolution from 
`Start > Settings > Control Panel > Display.')

If your monitor has limited screen resolution, then you may instead
wish to run {\DVIWindo} and the editor full screen.
To switch between them in this case % simply 
use Windows' standard method:
hold down the `Alt' key and press % `Tab'
\ang{Tab} until you get to the
desired window %
(to step in reverse order, hold down the `Shift' key as well).

Alternatively, you can use the `TeX' menu to transfer control to the editor.
Installation creates entries that {\it switch\/} to a window 
(rather than {\it launching\/} a new copy of an application). %  the editor).
By convention such entries are marked with an initial `€->€' in 
the `TeX' menu.  
Like all other entries in the `TeX' menu, these may be associated 
with hot keys. % also. 
For example, to switch to the % {\PFE} 
editor window, hold down the
`Ctrl' key and hit F9 (denoted C-F9 in the `TeX' menu).

% \subsect{The {\tt dviwindo.ini} File}
\subsect{The {\secttt dviwindo.ini} File}
%
Preferences and user customizations %  for the system
are saved in €dviwindo.ini€ in your `windows' or `winnt' folder.
%
The €dviwindo.ini€ file has several sections, including:

\nlist
\item €[Window]      €\quad{\DVIWindo}'s preferences 
(`Preferences' menu); % in {\DVIWindo}

% reversed order of the two following 95/Sep/27

of the `TeX' menu.

% \item €[Documents]   €\quad Names of the most recently used €.dvi€ files;

% \item €[Registration]€

\endlist

\noindent
The environment variables tell various components of the 
\yandytex\ System where files are located, as well as general 
preferences you have expressed during installation. 
%
The environment variables can be edited from {\DVIWindo}'s 
`Preferences{\down}Environment Variables' menu. 
%
The €[Environment]€ section is typically the only part 
of €dviwindo.ini€ that you may want to make adjustments to.
% Actually, if you have installed the \yandytex\ System as described in
% section~2, then you may well never have to even 
% look at the [Environment] section. % of % at the €dviwindo.ini€. % file. 
% If you did not install it the standard way, then you may.

% €news.txt€ files in the €\dviwindo€ directory. 
% Here, we will discuss the environment variables. 
%
% Next, we will discuss the environment variables. 
% Anyway, 
Here follows a sample €[Environment]€ section:

\endlines

% €TEXANSI=0€
% €DUMMY=1€

\noindent
% These environment variables can also be changed 
% by editing €dviwindo.ini€ using any plain {\ASCII} text editor
% such as `Notepad,' `WordPad,' `WinEdt' or {\PFE}.
%
If you want to edit €dviwindo.ini€
simply open it in some plain text editor like 
Notepad, Wordpad, WinEdt or {\PFE}.
A `{\DVIWindo} {\sc ini}' icon is already set up 
({\it not\/} the `{\DVIWindo}' icon itself) for this purpose.
This launches `Notepad' and reads €dviwindo.ini€ from the Windows folder. 
%
% The environment variables are listed in the
% €[Environment]€ section.
After making changes, select `File{\down}Save' and then `File{\down}Exit.'

\tip % Advanced Feature:
If a folder in a list of folders ends with a backslash (€\€),
then {\TeX} will {\it also\/} search first level subfolders % subdirectories 
of that folder. % directory.  
If it ends with a {\it double\/} backslash (€\\€) then {\TeX}
will search {\it all\/} subfolders % subdirectories 
recursively  (Use these capabilities sparingly --- 
it takes extra time to search complex trees of folders).

%% the above is repeated later

If your €dviwindo.ini€ file is missing entries for
some of the environment variables,
then the \yandytex\ System may not find all of the files it needs 
({\it unless\/} you happen to have installed all system components 
in the standard folders). % directories). 

If a problem does arise, then we recommend that you edit your
€dviwindo.ini€ file.  You'll know there's a problem if \TeX\ complains:

\beginlines
€Sorry, I can't find that format; will try the default.€, or perhaps
€! I can't find file € `\angi{file\-name}.'
\endlines

\noindent
If the corresponding files {\it do\/} exist, then the problem 
most likely is with the environment variables. 
%
The same may be true when {\TeX} can't find font metric (€.tfm€) files.

% By the way, older versions of \yandytex\ 
% (as well as many other {\TeX} systems)
% (as well as most of our competitors)
% used {\DOS} environment variables instead of 
% an `ini' file for this purpose.

%%% autoexec.nt and config.nt are the defaults used

%% use bulleted list for following?

\subsub{What the Environment Variables Mean}
%
\ulist
\item €TEXINPUTS€\quad Where \TeX\ style-
and source files may be found
-- {\it unless\/} a `format specific' environment variables overrides 
this --- see below. % reference to same section
This is {\it one\/} environment variable you may actually find 
yourself modifying as you add more folders % directories 
with {\TeX} style files.
Installation sets this to a semicolon-separated list, e.g.,

\beginlines
€TEXINPUTS=c:\texinput;c:\yandy\texinput;c:\yandy\tex\base\\€
\endlines

% €TEXINPUTS=c:\texinput;c:\letters;c:\books;c:\yandytex\latex€

\noindent 
The installation program 
puts folders with plain {\TeX} files
and miscellaneous other useful files supplied with the system
on this list and
asks for additional folders during installation. 
%
Note the €\\€ at the end of the entry for the 
€\tex\base€ subfolders. % subdirectory.  
This invokes recursive subfolder search.
That is, files in this folder % directory 
and {\it all\/} subfolders below it are included.
% (typically €c:\yandytex\latex€).

%% used when ini-TeX is run

\endlist

%%% what about format specific `TEXINPUTS' ???

\noindent
By the way, \yandytex\ always searches the current directory % folder 
first when looking for input files, so there is no need to add `€.;€'
to the list of folders % directories 
in €TEXINPUTS€.

% \endlist

\tip % Advanced Feature:
If you have an environment variable with the {\it same\/} name as the current
`format' % being used
% you are using, 
then {\it its\/} value will be used by {\TeX} 
{\it instead} of the value of €TEXINPUTS€.  
% Hence variables named 
% €PLAIN€, €LPLAIN€, €LATEX€, and €AMSTEX€
% are used instead of €TEXINPUTS€ when you use
% plain {\TeX}, {\LaTeX} 2.09, {\LaTeXe}, and {\AMS} {\TeX} respectively.
%
This is particularly convenient when two `formats' 
(such as {\LaTeX}~2.09 and {\LaTeXe})
use different style files with the same name % but quite different content.
(which otherwise could be quite confusing!).
You can, for example, have `format specific' environment variables named:

\ulist
\item \quad €PLAIN €\quad folders with \TeX\ source files for plain {\TeX};

\item \quad €AMSTEX€\quad folders with \TeX\ source files for {\AMS} {\TeX};

\item \quad €LPLAIN€\quad folders with \TeX\ source files for {\LaTeX} 2.09;

\item \quad €LATEX €\quad folders with \TeX\ source files for {\LaTeXe}.

\endlist 

\noindent
The names derive from the names % is because 
of the corresponding format files: % are called
€plain.fmt€, €amstex.fmt€, €lplain.fmt€, and €latex.fmt€.
% respectively.

Note that these `format specific' environment variables must 
{\it also\/} list the  folders % directories
containing your own \TeX\ source files --- as in €TEXINPUTS€ ---
since the list is used {\it instead\/} of the default % list provided by 
€TEXINPUTS€,
rather than being appended to that list.

Also note that ini-{\TeX} {\it does\/} refer to  €TEXINPUTS€,
since no formats are pre\-loaded when it runs.
So should you ever have to use ini-{\TeX}, make sure that
all the folders you will be referring to are listed in €TEXINPUTS€
(or alternatively that all files needed are in the current directory
where you run ini-{\TeX}).

%% ini TeX refers to TEXINPUTS ...

\ulist
\item €TEXFONTS€\quad Where \TeX\ €.tfm€ metric files may be
found
(actually, typically an `encoding specific' variable
will be used in stead of  €TEXFONTS€ --- see below).
% The installation adds references to the appropriate directories.

% the €\fonts€ subfolder % subdirectory 
% to this list.
% The €\€ after €fonts€ invokes one-level down subfolder % subdirectory 
% search. % (see below).
% TEXFONTS=c:\yandy\fonts\tfm;c:\yandy\fonts\€
% not needed if all €.tfm€ files are in subdirectories
% of the default €fonts€ subdirectory.
\endlist

\noindent
The first folder in the €TEXFONTS€ list is where 
new €.tfm€ files created by `WriteTFM\ellipsis' and {\AFMtoTFM} 
are deposited --- see section~3.7.2.
It may also be where 
the €texfonts.map€ font name aliasing file is found --- see section~3.7.3.

\tip % Advanced Feature:
If you have an environment variable with the {\it same\/} 
name as the current text font encoding, then its value 
will be used % by {\TeX} 
{\it instead} of the value of €TEXFONTS€.  
%
This makes it easy to switch font encoding from 
`Fonts{\down}Encoding' in {\DVIWindo}.

The default installation, for example, sets up
% You can, for example, have 
`encoding specific' environment variables named:

\ulist
\item \quad €TEXNANSI €\quad folders with {\TFM} files for {\TEXNANSI} (LY1);

\item \quad €ANSINEW€\quad folders with {\TFM} files for Windows ANSI;

\item \quad €TEX256€\quad folders with {\TFM} files for Cork (T1);

\item \quad €TEXTEXT€\quad folders with {\TFM}  files for TeX Text (OT1).

\item \quad €STANDARD€\quad folders with {\TFM}  files for Adobe
Standard Encoding.
\endlist

\noindent
The following optional environment variables are {\it only\/} needed 
if files do not end up in the default places:

\ulist
\item €TEXFORMATS€\quad Where \TeX\ format files may be found; 
not needed if all €.fmt€ files are in the default €\fmt€ 
subfolder. % subdirectory.

\vskip .05in

\item €TEXPOOL€\quad Where \TeX's `string pool' file may be found; 
not needed if the file €tex.pool€ (used only by ini-\TeX) is in the
€\fmt€ subfolder. % subdirectory. 

% or tex.pool ...

\vskip .05in

\item €YANDYPATH€\quad Where the \yandytex\ System is installed.
Some system components use this to find other system files.
\endlist

\noindent {\DVIPSONE} needs the following environment variable:
% needs to know where the Type~1 outline font files (€.pfb€) are kept:

\ulist
\item €PSFONTS€\quad Where Post\-Script Type~1 outline font files
(i.e. €.pfb€ files) may be found. % It is 
Set to a semicolon-separated list of folders. % directories. 
The installation procedure normally figures out
(from €atm.ini€, €atmreg.atm€,  the registry,
or the `font' folder) 
where €.pfb€ files are kept --- 
typically it is €c:\psfonts€ or 
€c:\winnt\fonts€.
% or €c:\winnt\fonts€.
%% what if it is NT does it set it up for c:\windows\fonts ???
% In systems without {\ATM} this may instead be the €\fonts€
% subfolder of the €windows€ or €winnt€ folder.
%
This environment variable may not be set correctly if,
by mistake,
you install the system {\it before\/} installing any of the fonts.
\endlist

\noindent
The following is needed only if you want to call an editor directly from
{\TeX} when it hits an error 
% (that is, when 
(and you respond % with the choice €e€ to {\TeX}'s error prompt).
by typing `€e€' at {\TeX}'s error prompt).
This is not used much, since it is % typically 
usually more convenient to just
go back to the editor window that is already open.

\ulist
\item €TEXEDIT€\quad A command-line string used when calling an
editor from {\TeX}. % when it hits an error.  
This string may contain: €%d€
(replaced with the line number), 
€%s€ 
(replaced with the \TeX\ source file name),
and €%l€ 
(replaced with the \TeX\ €.log€ file name), e.g.,

\beginlines

% NOT: €TEXEDIT=c:\epsilon\bin\epsilon.exe %s +%d€

% TEXEDIT=c:\tools\cmds\vi +%d %s

% You need to use €%%€ in place of €%€ in a {\DOS} batch file...

\noindent
You can call for graphics inclusions
(€.eps€, €.tiff€, €.bmp€, or €.wmf€ files)
using their fully qualified names --- as long as you replace €\€
with €/€ in the file name so as to avoid confusing {\TeX}.
You can give just the file names --- without path --- if you set up the
following environment variable:

\ulist 
\item €PSPATH€\quad Semicolon-separated list of folders % directories 
in which inserted {\EPS} (€.eps€) files, Post\-Script headers, 
{\TIFF} (€.tif€) files, {\BMP} (€.bmp€) files, and
Windows Meta\-Files (€.wmf€) are searched for. 
The installation program asks for the folders in this list. 
% and adds to TEXINPUTS directories...
\endlist

\noindent Note that if your figure inclusion macros also make
{\TeX} read the {\EPS} files to extract bounding box information, 
then the directory with {\EPS} should {\it also\/} be appended to
your €TEXINPUTS€ environment variable --- or rather the corresponding
`format specific' environment variable.

%% move following to technical addendum ???

% \TeX\ normally writes its output files in the current directory. If you 
% want to redirect them, then set the following environment variables:

% \ulist 
% \item €TEXDVI€\quad Set only if you want \yandytex\ to redirect

% {\it that\/} variable instead of the default €TEXINPUTS€. 
% So you could, for example, have environment variables named:

% \noindent
% which list directories with style files for

% (€latex.fmt€), respectively.
% This is because 
% the corresponding format files are called
% €plain.fmt€, €lplain.fmt€, and €latex.fmt€, respectively.

The variable €ENCODING€ specifies the font encoding (character layout)
for non-CM text fonts.  This is initially set during installation 
and can be changed using `Fonts{\down}Encoding' in {\DVIWindo}.
the default % on systems with {\ATM} 
is `€texnansi€' ---  for {\TEXNANSI} (LY1) encoding 
(see section~6 for detailed character layout): %% section?

\beginlines

\endlines

% \noindent 
% In a Windows NT system running without {\ATM}
% the €ENCODING€ environment variable should {\it not\/} be set 
% since 
% (i) TrueType fonts cannot be reencoded and (ii) TrueType text fonts are 
% set up for `Windows ANSI' encoding. 
% $In this case €TEXANSI€ should be set to 1 as described 
% $next. % in the following.

% The above refers to an encoding vector file €texnansi.vec€ in the 
% directory specified by €VECPATH€ (see below). %% section?
%
% If you do use `texnansi' encoding, then you should also add a line 
% of the form €\input texnansi€ to your {\TeX} source file.

% Do the above in more detail somewhere else?

% The following will be set to €1€ if you % {\it instead\/} 
% indicated during installation that you want
% to use Windows {\ANSI} (€ansinew€) encoding ---
% as is appropriate for a Windows NT system without {\ATM}:

%% What to do if you change encoding ???

\noindent
Note that if you change the €ENCODING€ environment variable,
TFM metric files will be taken from a different place as
dictated by `encoding specific' environment variables.
Installation sets up parallel trees of folders with TFM files 
for this purpose.
% you must {\it also\/} change the €.tfm€ {\TeX} metric files to the ones
% appropriate for that encoding (see section~3.7.1). % ???

The following optional environment variables are {\it only\/} needed 
if files do not end up in the standard places:

\ulist
\item €VECPATH€\quad Where encoding vector files may be found. 
The default is the €\fonts\encoding€ subfolder. % subdirectory.
% {\DVIWindo} uses the €VECPATH€ variable to find encoding vector files
% when you select `Write TFM\ellipsis' or `Write AFM\ellipsis' in the `Fonts'
% menu. 
% (See section on `Font Encoding' for additional details).  %% section?
% \endlist
\endlist

% What about Write All TFMs... ???

\noindent
{\DVIWindo} uses the €VECPATH€ variable to find the encoding vector
specified by the €ENCODING€ environment variable, 
% well isn't that just the same ??? we can no longer choose ...
as well as encoding vector files needed
when you select `Write TFM\ellipsis' or `Write AFM\ellipsis' in the `Fonts'
menu. % and `Write All AFMs\ellipsis' and `Write All TFMs\ellipsis' ...
% (See section on `Font Encoding' for additional details).  %% section?
% 
% {\DVIWindo} also  uses €VECPATH€ when it looks for the encoding vector
% specified by the €ENCODING€ environment variable.

% \noindent
% An encoding vector file is a plain {\ASCII} file that gives the mapping
% from character codes (in the range 0--255) to glyph names.
%
% We recommend the `texnansi' encoding vector since it provides access to
% all 228 glyphs in plain text fonts, yet matches most of the hard-wired
% assumptions that {\TeX} makes about where accents and various special
% characters appears in the character layout.

\ulist
\item €SUBPATH€\quad Where font substitution files may be found. The
default is the €\dvipsone\sub€ subfolder. % subdirectory.
%  (or its €sub€ subdirectory)
\endlist

\noindent
A font substitution file can, for example, be used to let {\DVIPSONE} 
know which fonts are printer resident
(so it won't include them in the Post\-Script output).
The standard substitution file
(read when you do not explicitly specify a font substitution file 
on the command line) 
is called €standard.sub€ and lists Times-Roman, Helvetica, Courier, % and
Symbol, and Zapf Dingbats as printer resident. 
Refer to the Technical Addendum for 
more esoteric uses of font substitution files.

\ulist
\item €PREPATH€\quad Where {\DVIPSONE} % (and €PKtoPS€) 
preamble files may be found. 
The default is the €\dvipsone€ subfolder. % subdirectory.
\endlist

% also for PKtoPS

%%% dvipsone.bat ???

\noindent
{\DVIWindo} adds the `Use DVIPSONE' checkbox to the `Print' dialog box 
only if it can find {\DVIPSONE}.  % €dvipsone.exe€. % {\DVIPSONE}.  
{\DVIWindo} looks for {\DVIPSONE} along the % {\DOS} 
€PATH€ (set in €autoexec.bat€ in Windows~95/98 and 
from `Control Panel{\down}System{\down}Environment' in Windows~NT).
% €autoexec.nt€) % ???
and in the default folder. 
If this fails, it tries to find {\DVIPSONE} in the folder 
specified in €PREPATH€. % (as well as €VECPATH€).
So if the `Use DVIPSONE' check box is missing, try setting €PREPATH€ 
% (or €VECPATH€) 
to the folder % directory 
where {\DVIPSONE} may be found.
% See below for a description of these environment variables. %% section?

% {\DVIWindo} also  uses €VECPATH€ when it looks for the encoding vector
% specified in the {\sc encoding} environment.

% following is somewhat optional ?

% Note that it is possible with some software to write ``scripts'' that can
% edit €dviwindo.ini€; this may be more convenient than using
% {\DOS} environment variables and €.bat€ files. 

\subsub{The [Window] section of dviwindo.ini}
%
The other part of €dviwindo.ini€ that may be of 
occasional interest is the €[Window]€ section, 
which stores preferences and state information. % other useful information.

% \noindent
\TeX\ normally writes all of its output files in the 
`current directory.'
When called from {\DVIWindo}, the current directory 
will be {\it either\/}

% and can be changed there.

The working directory selected during installation is recorded
in the €WorkingDirectory€ entry in the €[Window]€ section.
If you do not want to use a common working directory remove this line
or comment it out using a semicolon (;).
Conversely, 
to use e.g. €c:\working€ as a common working directory add

\beginlines
€WorkingDirectory=c:\working€

\noindent to the €[Window]€ section.
%
You can also temporarily toggle the `Working Directory' option using
% `Fonts{\down}Working Directory' 
`Special{\down}Working Directory' 
in {\DVIWindo}.

If applications called from the `TeX Menu' cannot handle file
names with backslash (\char92) then add

\beginlines
€Deslash=1€

\noindent
to the €[Window]€ section.
This requests that {\DVIWindo} convert €\€ to €/€

calling other applications.

You can control command line arguments passed to
{\yandytex}, {\DVIPSONE}, and {\AFMtoTFM}
using `Preferences{\down}Command Line' in {\DVIWindo}.
This information is recorded in
the €Window€ section of €dviwindo.ini€.
% also makes it possible to pass command line arguments to {\DVIPSONE},
% {\yandytex}, and {\AFMtoTFM} when called from {\DVIWindo}.
The values associated with the keys
€DVIPSONE€, €TeX€, and €AFMtoTFM€ 
defined in the €[Window]€ section record this information.
For example:

\beginlines
€TeX=-w -j€ % -j

\noindent 
% tells {\yandytex} to truncate long file names to {\DOS} 8+3
% file name convention.
tells {\yandytex} to show accented characters on screen

%
You can also use this line to change exactly {\it what\/} is called. 
For example, to call €dvipsone.bat€,
with command line argument €-v€, 
instead of €dvipsone.exe€ when printing use

\beginlines
% €DVIPSONE=dvipsone.bat -v€
€DVIPSONE=c:\yandy\dvipsone\dvipsone.bat -v€

\subsub{Mouse Tricks and Accelerator Keys}
%
Most operations in {\DVIWindo} are easily discovered % assimilated
% discovered 
as you work with it,
since they are listed as menu items. % accessed via menu items.
There are, however,  `mouse tricks' 
% and several accelerator keys (hot keys)
% worth noting here, 
that may not be immediately apparent, 
since they do not appear in the menus,
as well as accelerator keys (hot keys) that you may have missed.

Three of the `mouse tricks' depend on defining a rectangular area.
In each case, the top left corner is fixed when you first press the 
left mouse button.  You extend the rectangle by dragging the mouse
while holding the left mouse button --- the mouse controls the right 
bottom corner.  The rectangle can be moved --- instead of resized ---
if you {\it also\/} hold down the {\it right\/} mouse button.
% you can reposition the whole rectangle without changing its shape.
The final shape and position of the rectangle is the one in effect
when you release the left mouse button.  The % actual 
action taken when you define the rectangle
depends on which combination of `Shift' and `Ctrl' keys are held down
when you first press the left mouse button.

\blist 
\item You can create a `Zoom In' rectangle by holding down the 
`Ctrl' key and using the mouse to define a rectangle as explained above.
The aspect ratio of the rectangle in this case is constrained to
be the same as that of {\DVIWindo}'s window. % that 
The rectangle % region
shown % is what 
will be blown up to fit into the window when
you finally release the left mouse button. %  to zoom in
Later, you can click the {\it right\/} mouse button to undo the `Zoom.'

\item You can create a `Ruler' rectangle % in a similar fashion 
by holding down the `Shift' key instead.
This is useful for measuring % horizontal and vertical 
distances. You may want to zoom in first if you want to make 
accurate % fine 
measurements.
Go to `Preferences\ellipsis{\down}Ruler Units' to select the ruler units.
(Note that this feature is disabled when the `Fonts Used' list is showing.)

\item You can also create a `Copy' rectangle defining
a rectangular region to be copied to the Windows
clipboard by holding down {\it both\/} the `Shift' and `Ctrl' keys.
% while defining a rectangle using the mouse.
The material copied may be pasted into other Windows applications,
and positioned, sized and clipped there.
This is a convenient way to insert mathematics typeset using {\TeX}
into typical {\sc wysiwyg}-type applications.
% (Note that this feature is disabled when the `Fonts Used' list is showing.)

\item You can reposition the page in the window simply by holding down the
`Alt' key and the left mouse button. 
% and moving the mouse allows you to position the page on the screen.
Just drag the page around by moving the mouse.

\item You can refresh the display --- should it ever become corrupted ---
% by double clicking on the window.
by hitting the `Enter' key. % changed

\item Space and Backspace move forward and backward a % one 
page,  keeping the current zoom factor and position on the page.

\item `PgDn' goes to the top of the next page. 
`PgUp' goes to the bottom of the previous. % page.

\item The `Home' and `End' keys take you to the beginning 
and the end of the current page respectively.

\item The `Ctrl-Home' and `Ctrl-End' keys take you to the beginning 
and the end of the file respectively  % or use |<- and ->|
(or use €|<-€ and  €->|€).

\item You can move to a new page by typing in a page number --- using the 
top row of the keyboard --- and then hitting the \ang{Enter} key. % return.

% \item The numeric keypad's €+€ and €-€ zoom in and out one step. 
% \item The numeric keypad's + and - zoom in and out one step. 
% respectively.

\item Ctrl+R opens the `Find' dialog box; 
% Ctrl+S repeats the previous search.  
% You can close the `Find' dialog box after the first search,
you can check a box to close the `Find' dialog box after the first search,
yet continue using Ctrl+S, which repeats the previous search.  

% we don't say much about search in DVI files ... should we?

\item \ang{Ins} % `Ins' 
(from the numerical keypad) closes the current file 
(if any) and opens the `File Open' dialog box.  
Note that % when you start, 
you can quickly go back to the file you last viewed,
% when you last exited {\DVIWindo} last,
by double clicking on the {\DVIWindo}
icon, hitting \ang{Ins} and then \ang{Enter}.

\item \ang{Del} % `Del'

% {\TIFF}s and {\EPS} previews), please see the Technical Addendum.

%% Does the following eliminate the need for the `TeX Menu Manual' ? 

\subsub{Customizing the `TeX' Menu}
%
The `TeX' menu is the `control center' or `shell' 
from which {\TeX} and other applications are called.
The installation of the \yandytex\ System sets up a useful % initial
`TeX' menu, but you may want to add entries, or modify existing entries.
%
To do this, hold down the `Ctrl' key before selecting an item
from the menu.  You can then 

\ulist
\item (i) edit and replace an existing entry (select `Replace'), 

\vskip .05in

\item (ii) add a new entry {\it after\/} the item selected (select `Add'), 

\vskip .05in

\item (iii) add a separator line after the item selected (select `Separator'),

\vskip .05in

\item (iv) delete the item selected (select `Delete'),  or

% or

\vskip .05in

\item (v) delete the item {\it after\/} the item selected (select `Delete Next').
\endlist

\noindent
The last mentioned capability is useful for removing menu separator lines, 
since separators themselves cannot be selected. % directly

The menu is organized as a series of `key=value' pairs.  
The key is the `Menu Item Name' that appears in the `TeX' menu, 
while the value is the `Application Call Pattern' that will be 
executed in  response to selection of that key from the menu.
%
The first menu item is hard-wired to `Preview'
the €.dvi€ file corresponding to the last file 
{\TeX} source file selected. % for editing or processing using {\TeX}.
As indicated before, this menu item is rarely used, since 
in most cases that €.dvi€ file is already being displayed.

% Usage with Borde & Rokicki's TeX Help  ...

Each menu item may be associated with a `hot key.'
Hot keys can be function keys (written F1--F12), or function keys
with the `Ctrl' key also held down (written C-F1--C-F12).
The hot key designation follows the menu item name,
with a vertical bar ($\,$|$\,$) used as a separator.
Note that F1 is hard-wired for `Help,' C-F1 for `Preview.' and
Windows reserves F10 --- which is equivalent to `Alt,'
and in some versions of Windows --- and some laptops --- 
F11 and F12 are % also 
not available.
%
% The default hot key for `Preview' is C-F1.

% The `value' associated with a `key'
The `Application Call Pattern'
can be any command line that calls % a {\DOS} or Windows program.
a Windows program, console application
or batch file. % (or {\DOS} program).
Obviously, such a facility would be of limited utility if only a 
{\it fixed\/} string
could be used, but simple string replacements on the `value' part provide
added power: % added flexibility:

% First of all, 
Reference can be made to any environment variable
using the notation 
€%€\angi{env var name}€%€.
%
Second, an €*€ (asterisk) is replaced with the name of the currently
open €.dvi€ file --- {\it sans\/} extension, or path.

Third, % a semicolon-separated list of directories followed by 
the pattern
\angi{list of dirs}€#€\angi{file name}
% a €#€ (number sign) and a file name 
triggers a search. % for the file in the listed directories.  
If a file with name \angi{file name} is found in one
of the folders % directories 
in the semicolon separated list, 
then the full path name of that file replaces the pattern.
% The resulting full path then replaces the
% list of directories, the €#€, and the original filename.

This is handy, since it makes it easy, for example, 
to insert the full path name of the {\TeX}
% is not always trivial to locate the {\TeX}
source file corresponding to the currently open €.dvi€ file.
This is no mean task, since
it can be in any one of the folders % directories 
listed in €TEXINPUTS€.  
%
Following the above rules, it is clear that
{\DVIWindo} will search for that file in the list of source 
folders if the notation €%TEXINPUTS%#*.tex€ is used.
%
Since this is such a common construction, 
€@.tex€ is accepted as a shorthand notation for €%TEXINPUTS%#*.tex€.

%% big question: is TEXINPUTS replaced with format specific ???

The pattern €"€\angi{arg name}\char124\angi{default value}€"€ 
is replaced by text you
are prompted to supply when the pattern is activated.  The string
\angi{arg name} appears in the title bar of a dialog box
to indicate what information is requested, and \angi{default value} 
(if present) is offered as the default value.

% also \angi{dir}€?€\angi{.ext}

Now let us suppose that you would like to use the `xyz' editor, 
which lives in the €c:\xyzdir€ folder; % directory;
you want it attached to hot key Ctrl+F5, 
and this editor takes €-v€ and the file name 
as arguments on the command line. 
If you want the new entry to appear % in the `TeX' menu 
after the one for `Notepad,' 
hold down the `Ctrl' key and click on `Notepad' in the `TeX' menu.
Then enter €XYZ|C-F5€ for the `Menu Item Name' (key),
and €c:\xyzdir\xyz.exe -v @.tex€ for the 
`Application Call Pattern' (value).
Then click `Add.'

%% redundant ???

A file name inserted
in the application call pattern normally uses €\€ (backslash)
as separator.  Some applications cannot handle file names with backslashes.
Add `€Deslash=1€' to the €[Window]€ section of €dviwindo.ini€
to force {\DVIWindo} to convert % backslash to slash on the command line.
€\€ to €/€ on the command line.

Typically {\TeX} `formats' are listed last in the `TeX' menu.
This makes it easy % for ini-{\TeX} 
to append a new format when you create it.
% Assuming €[Applications]€ section is last in dviwindo.ini
Of course, you can insert new formats anywhere in the menu 
simply using an application call pattern of the form:

\beginlines
€c:\yandy\yandytex\tex.bat +€\angi{format file name}€ @.tex€
\endlines

% €tex.bat +€\angi{format file name}€ @.tex€

\noindent
Note the use of `+' as an alternative to `\&' before the format name ---
this prevents problems in Windows~NT where ampersand on the command line
is interpreted by the system as a command separator.

The above refers to the batch file €tex.bat€ created during 
installation. % of \yandytex.  
Calling a batch file from the `TeX' menu rather than
calling an application directly offers the opportunity to control 
what happens before the application is run,
and what happens after it terminates.

Also note that
{\PIF} files can control execution of % {\DOS} programs in Windows.  
% console applications 
batch files (and {\DOS} programs).
{\PIF} files can be used, for example, to specify whether the application
will run full screen or windowed.  
The installation procedure
copies convenient {\PIF} files for {\DVIPSONE} and \yandytex.
You can edit these, or create new {\PIF} files for other applications
by right-clicking on the batch file and selecting `Properties.' % ???

Altogether then there are three ways to control execution of
an application called from the `TeX' menu: 

\beginlines
(i) in the `Application Call Pattern' itself, 
(ii) in a batch file called from the `TeX' menu, and
(iii) by using a {\PIF} file with the same name as the batch file.
\endlines

\noindent
% (or the batch file).  
%
% flush reference to DOS box ???
%
Finally, note that you can even select the fonts used 
in a windowed {\DOS} box by clicking on the 
`System Menu' of the box, and selecting `Fonts...'.  
Windows remembers the selection you have 
made for use in future {\DOS} boxes with the same title.

If details of the `TeX' menu still appear a bit % seems 
mysterious, check out the entries created 
by the installation program to see how these work. % in practice.
Just hold down the `Ctrl' key, click on a menu item, and after
inspecting it, click `Cancel' (unless you actually want to change it!).

\subsub{The [Applications] section of dviwindo.ini}
%
Note that while the `TeX' menu can be edited directly from {\DVIWindo},
it is also possible to alter it by editing the €[Applications]€
section of the file `€dviwindo.ini€.   
This may be useful should the `TeX' menu ever get seriously corrupted. 
Each line in the €[Applications]€ section is of the form 
`€key=value€.'
A typical entry might be

\beginlines
€LaTeX 2e|F8=tex.bat +latex @.tex€
\endlines

\noindent
Note that `TeX' menu entries can % also 
be used to transfer focus to
another window --- as opposed to launching a new 
Windows or console application.
Use €$Window(€\angi{window title}€)€ 
for this.
To transfer to the `Notepad' window, for example, % you may 
use a key-value pair of the form

% €-> Notepad|C-F2=$Window(Notepad...)€

\beginlines
€-> Notepad|C-F2=$Window(...Notepad)€
\endlines

\noindent
The ellipses (€...€) indicate that the window title need not match the 
the given text in its entirety, but may have additional characters
before `Notepad.'
% initial part of the window title, which may contain additional characters.
Conversely, if the ellipsis appears {\it after\/} the word `Notepad',
then the given text need only match the initial part of the
window title.

This is handy because title bars often contain not only the application name,
but also the name of an open file. % opened by that application.
Of course, you get an error message when there is no such window.

Here we have chosen to use €->€ as the initial characters
in the `key.'  This is {\it not\/} in any way interpreted 
by {\DVIWindo}, but {\it is\/} a useful 
mnemonic device to mark entries in the `TeX' menu
that merely transfer focus to an existing window --- 
as opposed to launching a new copy of the application.

% additional features of `TeX' menu ???

% compare with TeX Menu manual ???  Can we flush that one now ???

\subsect{\yandytexBold}
%
You can run \TeX\ (or \LaTeX, or what you will) from the `TeX' menu in
{\DVIWindo} by choosing the appropriate menu item using the mouse, % option.

You will also have batch files
€tex.bat€, €latex209.bat€, and €latex.bat€

% Uncheck Working Directory when running ini-TeX ????

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsub{Making new {\TeX} formats --- running ini-{\TeX}}
%
A `format' file (like €plain.fmt€) is a kind of dump of {\TeX}'s
state of mind after reading the definition for a particular dialect 
of {\TeX} (such as plain {\TeX}).
It is typically faster to load such a format file than to
read the {\TeX} source code defining the format
(although, these days, the time taken to load
these files is quite short).
\yandytex\ comes with ready made `format' files for
plain {\TeX}, {\AMS}-{\TeX}, {\LaTeX} 2.09 and {\LaTeXe}.

Consequently, you do not normally have to create new `formats'
However, should you ever need to create new formats, run `ini-{\TeX}.'
The preferred way % Probably the easiest way
to create a new format is to run  {\yandytex} 
using €-i€ on the command line from the command prompt 
(see below).

You can also create formats directly from the `TeX' menu
by selecting the `ini TeX' menu item.
For example, to create the \LaTeX\ 2.09 format file, 
you could select `ini TeX' % €iniTeX€
from the `TeX' menu and type €LaTeX 2.09€ for the `TeX' menu name
(adding any hot key desired following a vertical bar as separator).
Click `OK.'  Then type €lplain€\ang{Enter} for the source file name 
in the field that pops up.  Click `OK.'

The required files  €lplain.tex€, €lfonts.tex€, 
and €latex.tex€ are in the €\tex\latex209€ subfolder.
% The required {\TeX} source files defining this format
% are in the €\latex€ subfolder % subdirectory 
% of the €\tex€ subfolder, % subdirectory, 
% and this folder either should be the current folder, 
% or it should be be on the list of folders % directories 
Clearly that folder should be listed in the €TEXINPUTS€ environment
variable so that {\TeX} can find the files 
if this approach is used, since
ini-{\TeX} ignores `format specific' environment variables,
and always refers to €TEXINPUTS€.

% One convenient approach is to temporarily redefine the
% `Working Directory' to be the directory with the source files,
% by {\it unchecking\/} `Fonts{\down}Working Directory' 
% if it happens to be currently checked.

%%% Mention change of Working Directory check mark here ???

Note that with some formats you need to explicitly type
€\dump€ when {\TeX} returns to the '*' prompt,
while other formats may already include that command 
in the source code.

In some cases (like {\LaTeXe}) creation of new format files may be more
involved --- e.g. requiring two runs of {\TeX}.
% You may find it easier to handle this from the command prompt.
This is easier from the command prompt.
%
Note that `ini-{\TeX}' is nothing more than `{\TeX}'
with the command line flag €-i€.
To create a new format for \LaTeXe, using this approach, 
switch to the folder that has all of the {\LaTeXe} base files
% (typically €c:\yandy\tex\latex€).
% (typically €c:\yandy\tex\latex\base€).
(typically €c:\yandy\tex\latex\unpacked€).
These files may be the latest versions downloaded from {\CTAN}
({\LaTeXe} is presently updated every 6 months).
%
First run {\TeX} ({\it not\/} ini-{\TeX}) % or \LaTeXe) 
on the file €unpack.ins€ 
(which in turn reads €unpack.dtx€ and other files). 
For example:

%% need for recent version of docstrip.tex ???

\beginlines
€cd c:\yandy\tex\latex€
% €tex -v unpack.ins€
€c:\yandy\yandytex\tex -v unpack.ins€
\endlines

% \noindent
% If €tex.bat€ is not on your €PATH€ you need to give the
% fully qualified name €c:\yandy\yandytex\tex€ instead.
% You will also need to adjust the folders if you installed 
% in other than the standard €\yandy€ folder.
%
\noindent
After a minute or so, two or three hundred files will 
have been created.
%
At that point, run ini-{\TeX} on the file €latex.ltx€.
Then move the resulting €latex.fmt€ format file to the folder % directory
specified in the environment variable €TEXFORMATS€. For example:

\beginlines
% €tex -v -i latex.ltx€
€c:\yandy\yandytex\tex -v -i latex.ltx€
€move latex.fmt c:\yandy\yandytex\fmt€
\endlines

\noindent
Also make sure that the other new files created by the `unpacking'
process reside in a folder listed in 
% €TEXINPUTS€ --- or rather 
the `format specific' environment variable €LATEX€.
This happens automatically if you `unpack' the packed distribution
% from CTAN 
% in €c:\yandy\tex\latex€.
% in €c:\yandy\tex\latex\base€.
in €c:\yandy\tex\latex\unpacked€.

% the following should really be more general and appear elsewhere ???

Finally, to add a {\it new\/} format file to the `TeX' menu, select the menu,
hold down the `Ctrl' key and click on an entry 
in the bottom portion of the menu (for example, the one for 
% €LaTeX€). %% ?
{\LaTeX} 2.09.
A dialog box will pop up. Make the changes necessary to make your new format
file work (e.g. replace €+lplain€ with €+latex€), being
sure to give the `key' a unique name, and to associate it with a unique 
function key (if you wish to use that handy shortcut), and then click on `Add.'
Refer to section~3.3.2 on customizing the `TeX' menu for additional details.

Equivalently, you can edit the €[Applications]€ section
of €dviwindo.ini€ directly using `Notepad,' `WordPad,' `WinEdt' or {\PFE}.

%%% give section number ???

% not needed for existing formats.

\subsub{`Foreign' Language Keyboards --- Accented Characters}
%
If you are a typical mono-glottal English speaker you can ignore this! 
%  spelling ???

Many languages use accented characters, composite characters, or
special characters.  
There is, of course, a standard notation in {\TeX} to access such characters.  
For example, €\"a€ yields `\"a',
€\c c€ yields `\c c', and €\ae€ yields `\ae.'
But it is more convenient to represent these characters using a {\it single\/}
character code in the file, as we do for `ordinary' alphabetic characters.

With {\yandytex} you {\it can\/} type these characters directly 
from the keyboard and use the resulting {\TeX} source file as is.
%
There are three cases to consider:

\nlist
\item Normal text fonts (i.e. {\it not\/} Computer Modern) ---
font encoding matches keyboard character codes;
\item Normal text fonts (i.e. {\it not\/} Computer Modern) ---
font encoding does {\it not\/} match keyboard character codes;
\item Computer Modern fonts.
\endlist

\noindent
In case (1) all that needs to be done is to tell {\TeX}
about the font encoding.  
This is the case e.g. if you use a Windows editor to create the source file,
and set up the fonts for {\TEXNANSI} (LY1) or Windows {\ANSI} encoding.

For plain {\TeX} and {\LaTeX}~2.09, add €\input texnansi€,
when using TeX 'n {\ANSI} encoding.
For Windows {\ANSI} encoding, use €\input ansiacce€ instead.
%
With {\LaTeXe} instead use €\usepackage[LY1]{fontenc}€ (for
{\TEXNANSI}) or
€\usepackage[ansinew]{texnasni}€ (for Windows ANSI).

Conveniently, alphabetic characters and the 58 `standard' accented characters
have the {\it same\/} character codes in {\TEXNANSI}, Windows ANSI, 
ISO Latin~1, and even Cork (T1) encoding!

In case (2) character codes need to be translated from those
generated by the keyboard to those used in the font.
This is the case e.g. if you use a {\DOS} editor 
(which may e.g. use {\DOS} code page 850) % , or perhaps {\DOS} code page 437
and set up the fonts for TeX 'n {\ANSI} or Windows {\ANSI} encoding.

The translation can be accomplished by {\yandytex} itself
by specifying a translation table using 

\beginlines
€-x=<char code translation file>€ 
\endlines

% where does it look ??? need full path ???

\noindent on the command line. % argument with \yandytex.
% The translation table is read into {\TeX}'s €xchr[]€ table.
% The inverse of this --- the €xord[]€ table --- is used to 
% translate incoming characters before {\TeX} starts to analyze them.  
It is then as if the file had been entered using the encoding of the
font, not that of the keyboard.
Use €dos850wn.map€ to translate from {\DOS} code page 850
to Windows {\ANSI}
% Use €dos437wn.map€ to translate from {\DOS} code page 437.
(Additional sample €.map€ files are provided in the
€\yandytex\keyboard€ subfolder).

In case (3) character codes need to be {\it expanded\/}
into standard {\TeX} notation, since Computer Modern text fonts
do {\it not\/} have ready-made accented characters.

If you are using {\LaTeXe} then this can be taken care of using
€\usepackage[dos850]{inputenc}€.
This can also be done by {\yandytex} by specifying a 
keyboard character expansion table using 

\beginlines
€-k=<keyboard macro file>€ 
\endlines

% where does it look ??? need full path ???

\noindent on the command line. %  argument with \yandytex.
Use €dos1252.key€ for an editor set up for Windows {\ANSI}
% Use €dos850.key€ for {\DOS} code page 850.
(Additional sample €.key€ files are provided in the
€\yandytex\keyboard€ subfolder).

For additional details please refer to the file €keyboard.txt€
in the €\yandytex\keyboard€ subfolder. % ??? right place
% Sample translation tables €*.map€ and 
% sample keyboard expansion tables €*.key€
% are provided in this subfolder as well.

% Avoiding hexadecimal notation in output from TeX:

When TeX outputs information on screen or in the log file, it uses hexadecimal
notation (e.g. €^^cf€) for character codes above 126 and below 32.
This can make it hard to read text containing accented, composite,
or special characters in error messages.
Use the €-w€ command line flag to instead have these characters
printed `as is' (i.e. without conversion to hexadecimal).
This by itself works well if your source file was made using a {\DOS} editor.
If your source file was made using a Windows editor, then use in addition
the command line flag €-j€ to translate from 
Windows {\ANSI} back to {\DOS} code page 850. 

The ability to use full `8 bit' character encoding makes it possible to
set up proper hyphenation tables for languages using accented characters.
Hyphenation tables for many languages are available from {\CTAN}
and national {\TeX} user's groups 
(see the `language' subfolder of the `{\CTAN}' folder on the CD).
New formats must be created using ini-{\TeX} (see section~3.4.1)
when new hyphenation patterns are to be used. 
In {\LaTeXe} you may find that the `babel' package provides a good
mechanism for supporting multiple languages in the same document.

%%% but is beyond the scope of this introductory manual ???

\subsect{DVIPSONE}
%
{\DVIPSONE} is the special Post\-Script printer driver.
It is simple to use: 
Just open the `File{\down}Print' menu in {\DVIWindo}, make sure the 
`Use DVIPSONE' check box is checked, click on `OK' % and press \ang{Enter}
(Of course, you can change the entries in the dialog box if you wish).
You can control what `port' you are printing to by first 
using `File{\down}Print Setup.'
{\DVIPSONE} assumes that all of the fonts
(the actual €.pfb€ font files) 
that your \TeX\ job uses may be found % are
in the folder pointed to by €PSFONTS€.
%
This is typically €c:\psfonts€ when using {\ATM}.
In Windows~NT without {\ATM} it may be the €\fonts€ subfolder
of the €winnt€ folder. %  or the €\system€ subfolder.
% normally set up during installation...

%% This may be €c:\windows\fonts€ or €c:\windows\system€ ???

If you have a set of command-line flags and arguments
for  {\DVIPSONE} that you use 
all the time, then you may want to set these up using
`Preferences{\down}Command Line' in {\DVIWindo}.

% then you can add an entry to the €[Window]€ section of
% €dviwindo.ini€ of the form 
% €DVIPSONE=€\angi{command line options},
% which specifies command line options to be passed to {\DVIPSONE} when 
% called from {\DVIWindo}.
%
% (Alternatively, you can create a €dvipsone.cmd€ file in your
% €DVIPSONE€ directory containing the command line options ---
% please refer to the €readme.txt€ file for details).

% If you want to produce a Post\-Script file instead of sending output directly
% to a printer, then select a printer connected to the port {\sc file:}
% If you don't yet have a printer connected to {\sc file:}, double click 
% on `Printers' in the Windows control panel to `Install' a new printer
% driver on that port, or to `Connect' an existing on to {\sc file:}.
% (of course, you won't use that actual printer driver, but...

You can also tell {\DVIWindo} which printer ports have % are attached to

To enable this feature, in the €[Window]€ section of €dviwindo.ini€, 
add e.g. a line of the form 

% €UseDVIPSONE€ line in  reflect your printer port.
% If you have problems printing (i.e., no output), you may need to edit the
% €UseDVIPSONE€ line in €dviwindo.ini€ to reflect your printer port.
% While

\beginlines
€UseDVIPSONE=LPT1:;FILE:€
\endlines

\noindent which means that you normally want to use {\DVIPSONE} for 
a printer on €LPT1:€, as well as when `printing to file'
(but not when printing to other ports ---
like €COM2:€ say).
If you {\it never\/} want the `Use DVIPSONE' box checked, then use instead
€UseDVIPSONE=BOGUS:€ (or uninstall \DVIPSONE).

The window in which {\DVIPSONE} is running when it is called from 
{\DVIWindo} will persist if an error occurs.
%% once we have the batch file fixed up ???
This is so that you can read the error information at your leisure.

\subsub{Printing to File}
%
{\DVIPSONE} normally is used to print directly to some printer port.
To create a Post\-Script file instead --- to send to a service bureau, say --- 
click the `Print to File' check box in the printer dialog
(or choose a printer connected to the `port' {\sc file:}).
Then, when you print, you will be asked for a file name to use.
% for the output.
%
This can be a handy way of feeding {\PS} files to Acrobat
Distiller's ``watched folder.''

% Is the following still needed ???

% If you don't yet have a printer connected to {\sc file:}, double click 
% on `Printers' in the Windows Control Panel to `Install' a new printer
% driver on that `port,' or to `Connect' an existing one to {\sc file:}.
%
% (of course, you won't use that actual printer driver, but...
% You may need to `Install' a printer from the Windows Control Panel
% (in the `Main' program group) and `Connect' it to the `virtual port'
% called €FILE:€.

% following somewhat optional

If you then decide to {\it print\/} the Post\-Script file locally after all
(perhaps to check that everything is {\sc ok})
you can just use the % {\DOS} {\sc copy} command.
{\sc copy} command from the command prompt.
But you must then take into account the fact that Post\-Script printers 
(on serial ports and parallel ports at least)
expect to receive a Ctrl+D  (character code 4) % ({\ASCII} 4)
at the end of each job. % (to reset their virtual memory).
The Ctrl+D is an `end of job' 
signal and resets the printer's virtual memory. %  in the printer.

{\DVIPSONE} automatically adds this character when it sends
its output {\it directly\/} to a printer, but control characters 
designed for controlling a % serial 
communications link are not
valid % strictly 
in a Post\-Script file, so the Ctrl+D is omitted when 
`printing to file.' % does not contain this character.
%  whether from {\DVIWindo} or from {\DOS}.)
% You can add the Ctrl+D back in again as follows:
You can re-append the dropped Ctrl+D again as follows:

\beginlines
€copy book.ps+c:\yandy\ps\controld.ps lpt1:€
\endlines

% €copy book.ps+c:\yandy\dvipsone\controld.txt lpt1:€

% €copy book.ps+c:\dvipsone\controld.txt lpt1:€

\noindent
The file €controld.ps€ contains nothing but a Ctrl+D character.
%
For convenience you may wish to create a simple one-line batch file,
€send.bat€ say, which contains the following:
% above line, but where the filename \angi{book} % ?
% is replaced with €%1€, referring to the argument
% given to the batch file. % The batch file takes one argument, 

\beginlines
€copy %1+c:\yandy\ps\controld.ps lpt1:€
\endlines

% €copy %1.ps+c:\yandy\dvipsone\controld.txt lpt1:€

\noindent
The single argument is the name of the PS file.

You can also add a preview to an {\EPS} file that does not have one
using a PS % Post\-Script 
interpreter such as Transverter Pro\registered\ from TechPool Software, 
or GhostScript.
But the details are beyond this introductory manual.

\tip % Advanced Feature:
If you do not use the extension €.eps€ in the call to insert the file,
{\DVIWindo} will look for a file with extension €.eps€ for printing, but
try and find a corresponding file with extension €.tif€ for preview.
This is another way to `add a preview' to an {\EPS} file that
does not have one.
%

You should know that €epsf.tex€ reads the {\EPS} file to find the
Post\-Script comment that defines the bounding box for the figure in 
order to figure out how much space to allocate on the page. 
This may not work as expected if the {\EPS} file contains a preview in 
{\TIFF} or {\WMF} format ---
yet, previews are obviously useful.
% because {\DVIWindo} shows previews on screen. 
For this reason, use % Please use % refer to 
the file €epsfsafe.tex€ {\it instead\/} of €epsf.tex€.
It contains a simple fix to the bounding box reading code 
to deal properly with previews. 
%
Other style files provide alternative high level interfaces for
figure inclusion.  
One popular one is €psfig.sty€.
It has a similar problem with previews in {\EPS} files.  
Use €psfigfx.sty€ instead.
% Please refer to the Technical Addendum
% or the file €psfigfix.txt€ % until Technical Addendum is finished
% for information on how to modify % the official 
% €psfig.sty€. % so it works properly.

Note that at the lowest level, 
{\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE} support twelve % more than ten 
different schemes for figure inclusion (see Technical Addendum).
This is necessary because there is no standardization --- 
every printer driver and previewer uses a different scheme!  
We recommend using high level interfaces like
the \LaTeXe\ graphics package, 
€epsf.tex€ or €psfig.sty€ whenever possible to 
avoid running into problems. % at the low level. 

% If your Post\-Script art files are in  €c:\eps€, %
% €c:\tex\figs\ps€,

% The same goes for inserted {\TIFF} and Windows Meta\-File images.

% \subsub{Including {\dsc TIFF} and Windows Meta\-File Images}
\subsub{Including {\dsc TIFF}, {\dsc BMP} and {\dsc WMF} Images}
%
In addition to inclusion of images in {\EPS} form,
{\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE} provide support for insertion of
images in {\TIFF} format.  
For images (rectangular arrays of gray levels or color tones), 
{\TIFF} provides a natural format --- typically much more
compact than the equivalent {\EPS} file.  
Also, there is no need in this case for a separate `preview,'
since {\DVIWindo} can show the {\TIFF} file directly .
% (although this can be a bit slow for {\it very\/} large {\TIFF} images --- 
% so you may want to disable this feature by unchecking 
% `Preferences{\down}Show Previews').

One disadvantage of the {\TIFF} file format is that it is a complicated,
compact binary form that {\TeX} itself cannot read.  So it is not possible
for figure insertion macros to % directly 
determine the image dimensions directly from the image file 
(the way they do with {\EPS} files)  
---  you have to supply them. % by hand.  
You can obtain the required information 
% required number of columns and rows in the image 
using the utility {\TIFFTAGS}, which % is supplied with {\DVIWindo}.  
may be found in the €\util€ subfolder.
% Look for the tags `ImageWidth' and `ImageLength' --- ignore the rest.
This shows the image width and height
(for more details use €-v€ on the  {\TIFFTAGS} command line).
%  will be shown at the end of the listing. 
% output produced.

The low level interface for insertion of an image in {\TIFF} format is 
€\special{insertimage: €\angi{TIFF filename}€}€.
Refer to the file 
€tifftest.tex€ for sample macros that use this interface.
%
% is this file included ???
%
% €\special{insertimage: €\ang{filename} \ang{width} \ang{height} €}€.
%
% The \ang{width} and \ang{height} arguments after the {\TIFF} file 
% name are optional.
% You can also optionally specify width and height after the % {\TIFF} 
% file name:
You can specify scaling:

\beginlines
% €\special{insertimage: €\angi{TIFF filename} \angi{width} \angi{height}€}€.
€\special{insertimage: €\angi{TIFF filename} €scaled€ \angi{x-scale} \angi{y-scale}€}€.
\endlines

\noindent
If only one scale-factor is specified, it is used for both
directions (i.e. the figure will be scaled isotropically).
An alternative form of this command is:

\beginlines
€\special{insertimage: €\angi{TIFF filename} \angi{width} \angi{height}€}€.
\endlines

\noindent
The units for width and height are {\TeX}'s `scaled points,' 
of which there are 65536 per printer's point --- of which in turn 
there are 72.27 per inch
(these are the units used by {\TeX} in its internal calculations).
If height is omitted (or set to 0), then the image is scaled
isotropically --- that is, the height is computed from the width
using the aspect ratio specified in the image file.
If both height and width are omitted (or set to 0), 
then the `natural size' is used --- if specified in the file.

You can include Windows Bitmap files (\BMP) using the same mechanism.
{\BMP} files are much simpler than {\TIFF} files but correspondingly 
less flexible.

% this is a bit abbreviated, the file may not have a natural size...

% flush the following to make space ...

% A third optional argument --- after width and height --- specifies which 
% image to use in the rare case that a {\TIFF} file contains more than one.
% The default is to use the first image in the file.

{\DVIWindo} also provides for inclusion of images in 
Windows Meta\-File (\WMF) format.
% (However, {\DVIPSONE} cannot use them).
{\DVIWindo} can even use files saved from the Windows clipboard, 
{\it provided\/} they contain a placeable % Windows 
Meta\-file 
(i.e. a format listed as `Picture' in the `Display' menu
of the Clipboard Viewer).

% Enhanced MetaFile

% Clipboard Viewer: Display

{\bf Note:} Unlike {\DVIWindo}, {\DVIPSONE} % , on the other hand, 
does {\it not\/} support Windows Meta\-Files,
since such files are basically just recordings of a sequence of 
Windows Graphical User Interface ({\sc gui}) calls, 
and thus require Windows for interpretation.

The low level interface for insertion of an image in {\WMF} form is 
€\special{insertmf: €\angi{WMF filename}€}€.
%
% One form for insertion of WMF files using scale factors to control size is 
Optionally they can be scaled:

\beginlines
€\special{insertmf: €\angi{WMF filename} €scaled€ \angi{x-scale} \angi{y-scale}€}€.
% €\special{insertmf: €\angi{WMF filename} \angi{x-scale} \angi{y-scale}€}€.
\endlines

\noindent
The image will be scaled isotropically if you specify a single scale factor.
If you specify two scale factors, the first will be used to scale the image
in the {\lbmi x}-direction, while the second will be used to scale it in the
{\lbmi y}-direction.  % This provides for anisotropic scaling. 
%
An alternate form for insertion of WMF files is:
% much like the one used for {\TIFF} image insertion) is:

\beginlines
€\special{insertmf: €\angi{WMF filename} 0 0 \angi{width} \angi{height}€}€.
\endlines

\noindent
The utility {\WMFSPY} can be used to extract basic information about
a `placeable' {\WMF} file, such as the coordinates of the corner of the
`window' in which it is drawn, and the units of those coordinates.
This can be useful in reserving space on the page for the {\WMF}
(although there is actually no {\it guarantee} that the figure lies entirely
within the window specified in the {\WMF} header). % of the file).

\subsub{Color}
%
{\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE} both support a % simple 
simple and widely accepted scheme for color supported under \LaTeXe.
If you are using \LaTeXe, then please use the `color' package.

%% maybe move this to Technical Addendum ???

If you for some reason you do need a low-level interface 
(e.g. you are using plain {\TeX}) then read on.
The low level interface is €\special{color €\angi{color spec}€}€.

% also allows color: with colon as alternative form

You can specify color using:
(i) gray level, 
(ii) {\sc rgb} (red, green, and blue), or % components, or
(iii) {\sc cmyk} (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) components:

\beginlines
€\special{color gray <g>}€.
€\special{color rgb <r> <g> <b>}€.
€\special{color cmyk <c> <m> <y> <k>}€.
\endlines

\noindent
In each case the numbers should lie in the 0.0 to 1.0 range. % in each case.
{\sc rgb} is more appropriate % convenient 
when specifying color for a display screen (additive color system),
while {\sc cmyk} provides better control when printing
(a `subtractive' color system).
%
% Unfortunately, we cannot go into a deeper discussion of 
% color issues in this introductory manual.

It is also possible to `push' (save) the current color state, 
and to later `pop' (restore) it again.
%% and these can be combined
In the following, for example, the word `blue' will appear blue ---
both on screen and on a color printer ---
while the surrounding text will appear in black, as usual.

\beginlines
€Just once in a€
€\special{color push}%€
€\special{color rgb 0 0 1}%€
€blue€
€\special{color pop}%€
€moon.€
\endlines

%% too much space between lines ???

\noindent
Note the use of €%€ at the end of each line
containing €\special{..}€ to prevent the €\special{..}€ % it
from inserting spurious white space
--- or having other unwanted side effects.
By the way, you can combine color commands, although the only
combination that makes much sense is €push€ followed by 
a color specification. 

% (it is generally a good rule to end each line in a {\TeX} macro
% definition with €%€ to prevent spurious white space from
% being introduced).

% Note that
Both {\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE} go to some considerable
trouble to correctly deal with color changes that extend across
page breaks.  They determine the state of
the color push down stack at page breaks in prescan
of the €.dvi€ file in order to make it possible to preview of pages in
arbitrary order later on (and to print selected page ranges).

For display in {\DVIWindo}, % just 
make sure that `Fonts{\down}Color Fonts' is {\it not\/} checked,
since that takes precedence.
% in order to avoid interference with % this alternate 
% use of color to distinguish different fonts. 

On a black and white printer, by the way, 
color will be simulated using gray levels.
And on bi-level devices like laser printers, 
gray levels in turn are simulated using halftones.
So `colored text' will tend to look `choppy' on such a device.

If you use colored text, make sure
to push the color state and switch to black
when setting headers and footnotes;
afterward pop the color state again
(Note: this happens automatically if you use the {\LaTeXe}
color package). % David Carlisle
The reason this has to be done
is that {\TeX} may work on headers and footers at 
unexpected times --- possibly 
in the middle of a paragraph in which you have % temporarily
changed the color!

% For similar reasons, 
% serious color work may require modifications to {\TeX}'s €\output€
% routine to avoid problems at the point that {\TeX} decides to
% typeset a complete page % for the same reason
% (Unfortunately {\TeX} itself does not support color in 
% the same way it supports fonts).

%% give more details, why use cmyk instead of rgb ???

If you need to control the color of bi-level (monochrome)
inserted images in {\TIFF} format then use the `figurecolor' 
€\special{..}€ described in the Technical Addendum.

A complete treatment of issues relating to use of color in 
publications is beyond the domain of this introductory manual.

%%% color separations ?

\subsub{Hypertext Links}
%
{\DVIWindo} provides support for hypertext links.
You can establish rectangular `buttons' that are sensitive 
to clicking with the left mouse button, %  the user can click on, 
using 

\beginlines
€\special{button: €\angi{width} \angi{height} \angi{action}€}€.
\endlines

\noindent
The units for width and height are {\TeX}'s `scaled points.'
% of which there are 65536 per printer's point --- of which in turn
% there are 72.27 per inch
% (these are the units used by {\TeX} in its internal calculations).
Note that the button is not automatically made visible.  
You can draw the user's attention to the button by drawing a colored
rule % rectangle 
of the same shape and size, or by coloring the text over
the sensitive area of the button 
(see €hyper.tex€ for examples).  %%% make sure file included ???
In overlaying text on a rule defining the button area, 
you may find {\TeX}'s €\rlap€ control sequence of use.
% use \rlap ???

The \angi{action} most commonly specified is simply the name of a `mark' 
that is defined elsewhere in the same file using

\beginlines
€\special{mark: €\angi{label}€}€

\noindent
(If \angi{label} contains white space, use double quotes to delimit it).
% both in the mark and where it is called from ...

%%% Need to talk about automatic translation to pdfmark by DVIPSONE

Note that {\DVIPSONE} automatically translates hypertext links

\beginlines
€\special{PDF: Title ...}€
€\special{PDF: Author ...}€

for additional details.

The {\LaTeXe} `hyperref' and `backref' packages can generate appropriate
hypertext links for use with {\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE}.
You just need to let them know which `driver' you are using.

\subsub{Device Independent Rotation and Scaling}
%
% More appropriate for DVIWindo discussion?
%
{\DVIPSONE} supports a set
of €\special€'s for device independent coordinate system transformations. 
So does {\DVIWindo} --- but only in Windows~NT.  
These commands have the form
% \beginlines
€\special{CTM: € \angi{transformation}€}€.
% \endlines

Here `{\CTM}' stands for coordinate transformation matrix,
in analogy with Post\-Script terminology.
The \angi{transformation} may be rotation, scaling,
translation, or arbitrary linear transformation:

\beginlines
€\special{CTM: rotate <theta>}€
€\special{CTM: scale <sx> <sy>}€
€\special{CTM: translate <dx> <dy>}€
€\special{CTM: concat <m11> <m12> <m21> <m22>}€
\endlines

\noindent
Rotation, scaling and other % arbitrary 
linear transformations are
with respect to {\TeX}'s current point. 
That is, {\TeX}'s current point when mapped to the page {\it after\/}
the change in transformation is the same as what it was when 
mapped to the page {\it before\/}.

There are also alternate `asterisk' forms % with an asterisk (*) after
--- €rotate*€, €scale*€, and €concat*€ ---
which perform the inverse operations.
Finally, it is possible to save the current {\CTM} using
€push€, and to restore it using €pop€.
%
Note that €pop€ {\it also\/} resets the current point on the page
to whatever {\TeX}'s current point maps to under the
restored {\CTM}.
%
Finally, €popall€ restores the default {\CTM} and resets the stack.

{\DVIPSONE} also supports the use of raw Post\-Script for 
coordinate transformation --- {\it provided\/} the code 
is created in a form suitable for {\DVIPSONE}.
In {\LaTeXe}, this means that a €graphics.cfg€ file has been 
set up for this purpose  % see section ???
(containing just  €\ExecuteOption{dvipsone}€).
Alternatively the `graphics' package can be given
the €dvipsone€ option to tell it that % you are using 
{\DVIPSONE} is used as the `driver.'

For backward compatibility, {\DVIWindo} translates such raw Post-Script
coordinate transformation intended for {\DVIPSONE} into the corresponding 
{\CTM} action.
So in Windows~NT rotation and scaling requested via the `graphics' 
package will be obeyed when displaying typeset material on screen,
as well as when printing to non-PS devices from {\DVIWindo}.
%
This applies, for example, to the €\scalebox€ and €\rotatebox€ commands
available in the `graphics' package.

See €ctm.txt€ in the €\doc-misc€ subfolder % subdirectory
for additional details.

\subsect{Fonts}
%
If you will never use any fonts other than the Computer Modern set, then you
don't need to read this section.  However, there are thousands and thousands
of fonts out there (about 90,000 in Adobe Type~1 format alone!),
and many of them are very nice looking. So\ellipsis

% \TeX\ was originally written to use 128-character fonts; however, most fonts
% today have spaces for 256 characters. Eventually, \TeX\ was revised to use
% the upper half of the range as well.

\subsub{Font Encoding and Character Layout}
%
Inside a % {\TeX} 
source file, 
characters are represented by numbers % most 
% typically 
in the range from 0--255.
% Most
Electronic communication systems (such as email software)
are set up to depend % {\ASCII}
mostly on character codes in the range from 32 to 126.
Many of these 94 so-called 
{\ASCII} character codes
are mapped to the same glyphs % on most systems % every
(upper- and lowercase alphabets, numerals, and punctuation)
by most programs on most platforms.
Unfortunately, other character code assignments can vary widely
on different operating systems or different applications.
% correspond to different glyphs on different systems.
% and there are even some differences in the 32--127 range.

When we put on our typesetter's hat, all we care about is that a 
particular keystroke --- or {\TeX} control sequence ---
produces the desired glyph --- 
preferably the {\it same\/} glyph in whatever text font we use.  
In addition we would like access to {\it all\/} glyphs in a font,
not just those in a platform-specific encoding.
Finally, we may also want to be able to use a character layout that
matches the hard-wired assumptions in plain {\TeX} and {\LaTeX} 2.09
(inherited from the Computer Modern text fonts). % layout).
% like Windows {\ANSI} or Macintosh standard roman encoding.
Unfortunately, achieving all of those objectives has been far from simple.

\yandy\ has changed all that with `on the fly' reencoding.
{\it You\/} can decide what characters will appear in what positions in 
all your text fonts and so ensure that all fonts are perfectly consistent.
You can also gain access to any `unencoded' glyphs that may be in a 
text font, yet not be normally accessible in Windows 
{\it or\/} on the Macintosh.
%
(Windows {\ANSI} encoding lacks 15,  % now 13 in Windows 98 and NT 5.0
and the Macintosh standard roman encoding lacks 21 
of the `standard' 228 glyphs found in most  % Type~1 
text fonts). 

% ASE lacks 23 + 58  ...

The mapping from character codes (in the range 0--255) to glyph names
that you choose
is given in a plain {\ASCII} file called an `encoding vector file.'
% is a plain ASCII file that gives the mapping from
% character codes (in the range 0--255) to glyph names.
%
% We recommend the `texnansi' encoding vector since it provides access to
% all 228 glyphs in plain text fonts, yet matches most of the hard-wired
% assumptions that {\TeX} makes about where accents and various special
% characters appears in the character layout.
%
Several commonly used encoding vector files (extension €.vec€) may be found
% have been provided
% in the €\dvipsone€ folder. % directory.  
in the €\fonts\encoding€ subfolder. % subdirectory.
% or the €vec€ subdirectory...

% Unless you have some special reason to do otherwise...
We recommend that if you are using fonts in Type~1 format
% on {\ATM} compatible systems
you use the €texnansi€ ({\TEXNANSI}) encoding ---
unless there is some good reason to do otherwise. This

\beginlines
(i) provides access to 228 `standard' glyphs found in text fonts, 
(ii) matches ISO Latin~1 (and Cork) in the 160--255 range,
(iii) puts the lower 128 characters where \TeX\ expects to find them,
(iv) provides access to f-ligatures (`fi,' `fl,' `ff,' `ffi,' and `ffl') 
(v) avoids `white space' control character codes.
\endlines

\noindent
(Some other software has trouble with `white space'
`control characters' with codes 0, 9, 10, 13 or 32).
See section~6 at the end of this manual for detailed character layout in

% If you are using a system that is {\it not\/} {\ATM} compatible

otherwise you may miss special characters, ligatures and
accented characters in non-CM fonts.
In the \yandytex\ system, (ii) above is already automatically
controlled by setting (i), so all that remains 
for you to do is deal with (iii).

Note that Computer Modern (CM) fonts are not affected by
the setting of the encoding variable, because they are
not treated as text fonts by Windows and {\ATM}.

\subsub{Installing and Using Fonts}
%
To use a Type~1 font, first install the font.
%
In systems using {\ATM}, % compatible systems, 
add the font to your system using the {\ATM} Control Panel.
% (select €File{\down}Install€).
% (select €File{\down}Install New Font€).
Select `Programs{\down}Adobe{\down}ATM.'  % Adobe Type Manager
from `Start.'
% (or `Programs{\down}Main{\down}ATM' ).

%
In Windows~2000 --- without the {\ATM} font manager ---
you can install fonts by dragging the
fonts (€.pfm€ files) to the €\fonts€ subfolder of the €winnt€ folder.
% Alternatively, you can install them from `Fonts' in the `Control Panel'
% by selecting `File{\down}Install New Font.'
% In this process they are converted to TrueType format.
%
After installating a font, % you may want to 
check the font and its character layout using `Fonts{\down}Show Font'
in {\DVIWindo}.

%%% give more details ???  already done earlier

Second, copy or create the proper €.tfm€ file.   
Font sets designed for use with {\TeX} typically already

% Actually, 
% Note that 
In the case of the `Lucida Bright + Lucida New Math' and 
the {\MathTime} font sets, appropriate €.tfm€ files

%
% redundant now ?
%
% If you later change the encoding that you are using
% you will have to copy the appropriate €.tfm€ from 
% subfolders of €\fonts\tfm-lb€ or €\fonts\tfm-mt€
% (or the font diskette) to €\fonts\tfm-lb€ or €\fonts\tfm-mt€.
% In each case, 
There are already subfolders set up with €.tfm€ files for
(i) {\TEXNANSI} encoding (€texnansi€);
(ii) `Windows ANSI' (€ansinew€); 
(iii) `Cork encoding' (€cork€); and
(iv) Adobe Standard Encoding. % (€standard€).
% and Adobe StandardEncoding ???
% Use €encodtfm.bat€ to set up the appropriate €.tfm€ files
% (see section~3.7.1)

In the above case there is no need to create new €.tfm€ files.
%
If you {\it do} need to create a €.tfm€ file
for a new font you have installed,
% Then, to create the €.tfm€ file that {\TeX} needs, 
% From {\DVIWindo}'s menu, 
select `Font{\down}Write TFM\ellipsis' from {\DVIWindo} 
(or simply press Ctrl+M).  % not `Enter'...
Then % double-click on the desired font and the `style'
select the desired font and `style'
(regular, bold, italic, or bold italic).
{\DVIWindo} will first write a human readable plain 
{\ASCII} `Adobe Font Metric'
(\AFM) file in the €c:\yandy\fonts\afm€ subfolder. % right place ???
% (or its €AFM€ subdirectory).
It then calls the {\AFMtoTFM} utility. 
The resulting €.tfm€ file will % automatically 
be placed in the {\it first\/} folder % directory 
pointed to by the €TEXFONTS€ environment variable ---
or rather the `encoding specific' environment variable,
if one is defined.
% (typically €c:\yandy\fonts\tfm€).

{\DVIWindo} will advise you what the font file name is.  
Make a note of it, because it % this
is the name you will use to refer to the font in {\TeX}.
For example, if you made a €.tfm€ file for the Times-Roman font
(regular style), then the €.tfm€ file name would be €tir.tfm€.  
You can then refer to the font by that name in % plain
{\TeX}:

\beginlines
€\font\myfont=tir at 12.345pt€
€{\myfont This will appear in Times-Roman at 12.345pt}€
\endlines

% You can create the €.tfm€ file either directly from {\DVIWindo}'s menu 
% or from the {\DOS} command line.

\noindent
% Before using `Write TFM' make sure that the environment variables
% €TEXFONTS€ and €VECPATH€ are set up correctly, and that
% {\AFMtoTFM} is accessible from {\DVIWindo}.
%
To avoid confusion, it is best to do all four styles 
(regular, bold, italic, bold italic) of a given `face' at the same time.
% Note however that 
Some faces --- such as Symbol --- come in just one style.
% {\DVIWindo} will issue a warning if you select a non-existent style.
% Normally {\DVIWindo} doesn't offer up a style that does not exist.
% But should you get a warning about a `missing style' just click `Cancel.'

% It will no longer allow selection of non-existent styles.

If you have many €.tfm€ files to create, then you may 
want to take advantage of %  the features of
`Write All TFMs\ellipsis.'
This allows you to select various subsets of all installed fonts.
You can select Type~1 fonts, or TrueType fonts,
and you can select text fonts or symbol/decorative/math/pi fonts.
Finally, you can check a box to process `New Fonts Only' 
(i.e. those for which no €.tfm€ file exists yet).

Note that {\TFM} files are `encoding sensitive.'
New {\TFM} files have to be created when you change the 
encoding vector used for `on the fly' reencoding of text fonts.
`Write All TFMs...' is particularly handy in this situation.
Metric files for different encodings are kept in 
different directory subtrees so that they
do not conflict with one another.

% New €.tfm€ files are deposited into the first directory in the
% list of directories in the €TEXFONTS€ environment variable,
% by the way. %% redundant

%% where do the new TFMs end up ???

% de-emphasize following --- less important now

If you % already 
have the {\AFM}  % Adobe Font Metrics 
file of a font, then you can also create the €.tfm€ file from the 
% {\DOS} 
command prompt using the {\AFMtoTFM} utility. 
% In some rare cases 
This provides detailed control of the conversion,
which in some cases may be useful.
%
Most quality fonts come with {\AFM} files, although font installation 
using {\ATM} does {\it not\/} copy these files to the hard disk.
Look in the font folders on the CD % diskette
for {\AFM} files
({\AFM} files for fonts in the Adobe library may {\it also\/} be found

although it may take some poking around to locate them).
% `hidden' `system' files in odd directory structure
% to find it  % and no longer on ftp.adobe.com
%
In any case, to use {\AFMtoTFM} for a text font, type

% From the {\DOS} command line 
% in the directory where you keep your €.afm€ files, 
% €afmtotfm -c texnansi€ \ang{filename}, 

\beginlines
% €afmtotfm -vadx -c=texnansi€ \angi{AFM filename}, 
€c:\yandy\util\afmtotfm -vadx -c=texnansi€ \angi{AFM filename},

\noindent
from the command line.
% (The {\AFMtoTFM} utility is in the €\util€ subfolder ---
% if this is not on your €PATH€ you may have to give the full
% path in the above call).
Copy the resulting €.tfm€ file to one of the folders
% the first folder % directories 
listed in the €TEXFONTS€ environment variable ---
or rather the `encoding specific' environment variable
€TEXNASNI€.

The above command line arguments tell €afmtotfm€ what encoding vector to

`pseudo ligatures' (such as €---€ becomes €emdash€).
Run {\AFMtoTFM} with €-?€ on the command line to see other
% commonly used 
command line options.

Do {\it not\/} run `Write TFM\ellipsis' or {\AFMtoTFM} on {\it math\/} fonts.
% --- math fonts, symbol fonts, decorative fonts. 
% Doing so will gain you nothing but confusion. 
Math fonts use a fixed encoding, so there is no 
need to use anything but the €.tfm€ file that originally came 
with the font.  
%
Also, math fonts require additional fields in the {\TFM} file ---
which {\AFMtoTFM} {\it can\/} insert --- but {\it only\/} if it has 
an {\AFM} file specially prepared with additional typesetting
information added in `Comments' 
(in font sets from {\yandy}, such special {\AFM} files have the % basic
font name extended with the letters `tex').

% see \fonts\afm subfolder ...

%%% following is repetitious

% Note also that non-text fonts --- math fonts, symbol fonts,
% decorative fonts --- are designed to be used with {\it fixed\/}
% encoding and are not touched by `on the fly' reencoding in {\DVIWindo}

Pulling in a few new fonts for casual use is easily accomplished using the
method illustrated above.
Systematically replacing the traditional Computer Modern (CM) fonts with
other fonts is a more involved matter and requires non-trivial {\TeX} 
macro source files.

\subsub{Font Name Aliasing}
%
The font names for the Computer Modern fonts are standardized
across all platforms and all {\TeX} implementations.
Names for other fonts are not ---
different {\TeX} systems use different names.   %  for fonts

The \yandytex\ System by default simply uses the actual font file names.
Take the `Times-Roman' font again, for example.
The actual character outline programs are in the file €tir_____.pfb€,
while Windows metric information may be found in % the file 
€tir_____.pfm€.
These are the two files that {\ATM} copies to your hard disk 
when you install the font.

The metric information in human readable plain {\ASCII} format may be found
in the file €tir_____.afm€, while the {\TeX} metric information
in compact binary form is in €tir.tfm€ 
(note that for ease of use in {\TeX}, 
the €.tfm€ file name need not have the trailing underscores).
%  {\it not\/} extend the basic name with
%
The file €tir.tfm€ is constructed using `Write TFM...' 
from {\DVIWindo}'s `Font' menu (see previous section).
It can also be made using the {\AFMtoTFM} utility,
or just copied from the \MathTime\ font folder on the CD. % diskette

The relationship between the font file name (which is how you refer to the
font in \TeX) and the Post\-Script FontName may most easily be ascertained
by looking in the documentation that came with the font set, 
or in the font's {\AFM} file. % that came with the font.  
The {\AFM} file is a human readable plain {\ASCII} file that you
can open
in any editor, including `Notepad,' `WordPad,' `WinEdt' or {\PFE}.
% You could also use the {\sc decode} utility on the €.pfm€ file.

% If there is no {\AFM} file,
% % (all quality fonts should come with {\AFM} files),
% then use the utility {\PFBtoPFA} to convert the font's €.pfb€ file to
% €.pfa€ format.  You can then open the €.pfa€ file and look for
% `FontName' in the first few lines.
% % or look at the %!PS-Adobe comment line ....

In any case, when you refer to the Times-Roman font in \yandytex,
you use the name €tir€.  
% For example, €\font\myfont=tir at 12.345pt€.
Other {\TeX} systems may use other names for fonts.
% The \yandytex\ System provides 
There is a convenient mechanism for dealing with this.  
If you set up a file called €texfonts.map€
in one of the folders % directories 
listed in €TEXFONTS€ 
--- or rather the corresponding `encoding specific' environment variable ---
% (i.e. where your €.tfm€ files are kept ---
% typically €c:\yandy\fonts\tfm€),
then \yandytex, {\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE}
all refer to that file for font name aliases when they can't
find the font under the name specified in the % €.dvi€ file.
source file.

For example, Karl Berry has been assigning short names to fonts in an attempt
to standardize font naming.  If your source file uses `Karl Berry' names, 
then take the file €texfonts.kb€ supplied with \yandytex, and
rename it €texfonts.map€.  
%
As another example, note that Blue Sky Research's Textures\trademark\ uses 
its own unique set of short names for fonts.  If you have a {\TeX} source
file made up for Textures, then take the file €texfonts.bsr€
supplied with \yandytex, and rename it €texfonts.map€.

You can, of course, also make up your {\it own\/} font name aliasing file.
Each line in such a file contains two entries: the actual font file name,
followed by the name used to refer to the font in {\TeX}
(note order!).
Lines starting with semicolon (or percent) are treated as comments.

% names are limited to 32 characters ...

In the following we touch upon a few advanced topics.

\subsub{Page Imposition and Direct to Plate}
%
Post\-Script output produced by {\DVIPSONE} follows Adobe's
recommendations for Document Structuring Convention % Comments 
(\DSC).
In addition, the output is completely {\it page independent\/}
--- unlike output from many % virtually all 
Windows and Macintosh applications.
This makes it easy to extract pages and re-arrange them without
destroying the integrity of the Post\-Script job.
The utility {\TWOUP} (see section~5.1) % absolute section reference
exploits this % in order 
to make booklets
ready for saddle back stapling (such as the manual you are now reading!).

This also makes it easier for page imposition software to do its job.
Page imposition is the process of placing all the pages in a 
signature together and writing them onto a single piece of film.  
This saves the cost of manually stripping up individual pages.
Several companies provide page imposition software, 
including Adobe.
% PREPS, see below...
% and some damn company in Montreal, Quebec ...
Some of these systems require specification of `filters,'
mostly aimed at dealing with Post\-Script output that is 
{\it not\/} page independent.
% These are typically not required for output from {\DVIPSONE}.
% ScenicSoft, Inc. in Everett (Washington) 
ScenicSoft, Inc. (Everett, WA) offers a system called 
Preps\registered\ that is known to be compatible with output from {\DVIPSONE}
{\it without\/} use of any % special

\subsub{Color Separation and Color Trapping} % color separation  Quark
%
In order to print a document using colored text or inserted illustrations
that use color, it has to be separated into its `process color'
components.  This involves taking one Post\-Script file calling for color
and breaking it down into four `single color' or `black and white'
Post\-Script files, one for each of the %  four
process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow and black).

Several color separation systems are on the market,
including Publisher's Prism\registered\ by InSight Systems 
% in Vienna (Virginia).
(Vienna, VA).
These typically operate by modifying the basic Post\-Script operators.
The preamble of {\DVIPSONE} has been set up to allow this.

Color separation software tends to be fairly expensive, 
and usually is something a service bureau might use.
If you are on a budget, % , and willing to do a bit of work, 
you can used Quark XPress to separate your Post\-Script file.
To do this, you need to output each page
% that needs separation 
as a separate {\EPS} file, which is then imported into Quark XPress
--- somewhat tedious, but effective.

An important concern when using color is `trapping,' a geometric correction 
that should be applied to make the appearance of the printed result less
sensitive to % a method used to deal with the lack of 
inevitable small % slight % imprecise 
mis-alignment of the four plates when printing.
%  of the four process colors will never be {\it perfectly\/} aligned.  
While some aspects of trapping could be handled in the {\TeX} source file
--- or in the Post\-Script output from {\DVIPSONE} ---
complete solutions are complex.
The best bet is to use commercially available trapping systems.
Several companies provide trapping software, 
including Adobe and Insight Systems.

\subsub{Adobe Acrobat PDF}
%
% Currently 
The best platform-independent format for distributing documents
is Adobe Acrobat PDF. % lets stick our neck out!
Free Acrobat readers for Windows, Macintosh, and Unix are available
from Adobe % (from their {\FTP} site €ftp.adobe.com€).
at €http://www.adobe.com/readstep.html€. % readstep.html ???

% If you have Acrobat Exchange, 
You may be able to use the Acrobat PDFWriter from
{\DVIWindo} just like an ordinary printer driver.
But this is {\it not\/} recommended, % however, 
since the PDFWriter is limited
in its capabilities, and since it includes {\it complete\/}
fonts, which means your {\PDF} file contains copyrighted material that
cannot be distributed.

The best approach is to `Print to File' using {\DVIPSONE} 
% (which uses partial font downloading), 
and run the resulting PS % Post\-Script 
file through Acrobat Distiller.
You can even `Print to File' into Distiller's `watched directory'
to have it automatically convert the file when it is deposited.
% (included in Acrobat 4.0). %  with `Make Font Subsets' checked.  
% If you do this, use €-k€ and €-*2€ and €-*c€ command line
% options with {\DVIPSONE}.

In Acrobat 3.0 or 4.0 use `Distiller{\down}Job Options'
and select the `Font Embedding' tab.
Check `Embed All Fonts' and `Subset fonts below.'
Set this to 99\% (not the default 35\%).

% But {\it first\/} add a file (perhaps called €safe.ps€) 
% containing the line

% \beginlines
% €<< /SubsetFonts true /MaxSubsetPct 99 >> setdistillerparams€
% \endlines

% \noindent
% to the Distiller's €startup€ folder. % directory.

You then can create compact PDF files that can be viewed 
(as well as printed) on all platforms listed above
--- with % practically
the same quality as the original.
% (Because of problems with the current version of the Macintosh
% Acrobat reader, you may want to use the €-P€ command line flag
% with {\DVIPSONE} to suppress partial font downloading).
For best results, use the €-k€ command line flag with {\DVIPSONE}
and let Distiller find the fonts itself.
Also use the €-*2€ command line flag
to avoid problems in Acrobat Reader with certain `control characters.'
If you are using color, add the €-*c€ command line flag also
(so that {\DVIPSONE} will use the `colorimage' PS operator).
%
See €acrofix.txt€ in the €\doc-misc€ subfolder % subdirectory 
for up-to-date details.  

As explained in the section on {\DVIPSONE}, hypertext links are
automatically translated to Acrobat €pdfmarks€ by {\DVIPSONE}.
Please refer to €acrobat.txt€ regarding font licensing issues
that arise when distributing {\PDF} files containing fonts.

\subsub{Multiple Master Fonts}
%
Adobe Type Manager % ~3.0 and later
supports installation of Multiple Master 
({\sc mm}) fonts and the creation of new `instances.'
A Multiple Master font is a parameterized font, with up to four
control parameters, such as weight, width, and % design size. % 
optical size.
You select an instance of an {\sc mm} font by choosing particular 
values for these parameters.

You can use {\sc mm} instances just like `ordinary'
Type~1 fonts after they are created by {\ATM}.  
% Since 
There are no {\AFM} files for {\sc mm} fonts ---
% you have to 
use `Write TFM...' from {\DVIWindo} to create suitable €.tfm€ files. 
Just be careful to match the file names with the instances you are interested
in using --- make a note of the file names reported by {\DVIWindo}.

% In Windows~95, 
{\DVIPSONE} modifies the PS €findfont€ operator to automatically
create font instances as required,
and makes a note to include the corresponding {\sc mm} base font. 
%
{\DVIPSONE} can also automatically download the required 
`{\sc pss}' stub for each font instance.
Each base font called for is included (only once, of course).
{\DVIPSONE} supports partial font downloading for {\sc mm} fonts, which 
can significantly reduce PS file size.  
{\sc mm} text fonts are
reencoded `on the fly,' just like `ordinary' text fonts.

\section{Problems}
%
% refer to `readme.txt' and `news.txt' files ???
%
Of the problems that will occur in using this software, the vast 
majority will prove to be related to \TeX\ itself. 
Unfortunately, we at \yandy\ cannot provide technical support for 
\TeX\ questions.
% You'll have to ask your local guru, 

We're sorry about this --- but our relationship to \TeX\ is exactly like that
of a seller of compilers to any other computer language: We'll support our
product, but not the language itself.

If you need help, you can read one of many books on \TeX,  % we can give a list ...
or send a message to the €comp.text.tex€ news group on the InterNet.
% or contact the \TeX\ Users' Group 
% (\TUG). %  currently located in San Francisco...
% {\TUG} can supply a list of \TeX perts that will be happy to help 
% (for a fee).  % :=)
We also maintain a list of `TeXperts' on our web site
€http://www.YandY.com€.  Click on `Resources.'
%
Our web site also has additional support files and a
frequently asked question (FAQ) listing.

% we can also supply a list of experts...

% \subsect{Post\-Script Problems}
\subsect{Post\-Script Problems and Verbatim Post\-Script}
%
Another area in which \yandy's ability to help is limited 
is with Post\-Script code that doesn't % quite 
do what you expect.
%
If you are a Post\-Script programmer and are inserting 
verbatim Post\-Script code into \TeX\ €\special€s, 
please refer first to the Technical Addendum
and €verbatim.txt€ % on the {\DVIPSONE} diskette).
in the €\doc-misc€ folder. % directory). %% is that where it is ???
% until the Technical Addendum is done
% see the relevant section of the Technical Manual. 

If you are simply trying to use some off-the-shelf Post\-Script code 
(like rotation or figure inclusion macros), 
please check the macro package to ensure that it can work with {\DVIPSONE}. 
% In the case of {\LaTeXe}, just make sure you tell the `graphics'
% package that the driver is {\DVIPSONE}, using 
% €graphics.cfg€ and €color.cfg€ files
If you are using the `graphics' or `graphicx' package 
in \LaTeXe, make sure you have
€graphics.cfg€ and €color.cfg€ files 
containing €\ExecuteOption{dvipsone}€
% (or specify the €[dvipsone]€ % (or €[dviwindo]€) 
% option in the €\usepackage€ command).
(these files are normally already installed for you).
% in €c:\yandy\tex\latex\graphics€).

Beyond that, unfortunately, there is generally % absolutely
no standardization of the \TeX/Post\-Script interface, 
so what works perfectly well in {\DVIPSONE}
is quite likely to produce unexpected results when used with 
say, Tomas Rokicki's {\DVIPS} and {\it vice versa}
%
(For instance, rotation is counterclockwise in {\DVIPSONE} and
clockwise in {\DVIPS}). % €dvips€.
% (This particular problem can be dealt with by changing 90 to 270, 
% and 270 to 90, in €rotate.sty€).

Because we recognize that figure-inclusion macros are the most widely used
(and useful) of the `Post\-Script' €\special€s, we have written 
{\DVIWindo} and {\DVIPSONE} so they understand literally a {\it dozen\/}
% more than ten 
different figure-inclusion calls. Thus, if you have been using {\sc dvips}, 
{\sc dvi2ps} (either by Senn, Li, or von Bechtolsheim), {\sc dvitops}, 
{\sc dvilaser/ps}\trademark, {\sc dvialw}, Textures\trademark, or either
Oz\-\TeX\ or Psprint by Andrew Trevorrow, you will find that the same \TeX\
code will work with {\DVIPSONE}. 

If you have been using some other system, then you will % almost certainly have
most likely have to either alter your macros or change your % \TeX\ 
source files.
%
Fortunately, if you use higher level interfaces 
--- like the \LaTeXe\ graphicx or graphics packages,
€epsf.tex€ or €psfig.sty€ ---
there generally won't be any problems.

If you are using Timothy Van Zandt's PSTricks, 
make sure to use the  modified
€pstricks.pro€ and €pst-show.pro€ % 
(PS prologs) % (Post\-Script prologs)
and €pstricks.con€ (a {\TeX} configuration source file) supplied
(€.pro€ files are in the €\ps€ subfolder % subdirectory
and €.con€ files in the €\texinput€ subfolder). % subdirectory).
%
These files have been tuned for use with {\DVIPSONE}.

Note that neither {\DVIWindo} nor Windows includes a Post\-Script
interpreter, so output produced by `Post\-Script' trickery will 
generally {\it not\/}
be shown in {\DVIWindo}. % as it will print on a Post\-Script device.
To preview output of this form, `print to file' using {\DVIPSONE},
then preview the resulting PS file using 
Transverter Pro\registered\ from InSight Systems, or GhostScript.
% or Acrobat Reader after converting to {\PDF} format using Distiller.
%
Yet another alternative is to generate a Post\-Script file using
{\DVIPSONE}, pass it through Acrobat Distiller and view the
resulting {\PDF} file using Acrobat Reader.

The exceptions to the above statement are PS rotation and scaling commands 
emitted by the {\LaTeXe} graphics package, 
which {\it are\/} recognized by DVIWindo
% and translated to equivalent CTM \specials
and used to control on screen output --- 
but only when running in Windows~NT.

Note that some simple graphics are more easily produced % prepared % done 
using {\sc tpic} €\special€s.  
{\sc tpic} is device independent and is supported
by both {\DVIPSONE} and {\DVIWindo} (as well as some other drivers) --- 
so you will be able to see the results on screen as well as on the 
printed page.  
{\sc tpic} €\special€s are produced, for example, by
the {\LaTeX} €eepic€/€epic€ package.

Refer to the Technical Addendum (or €tpicspec.txt€) for details, and

\subsect{Some Previewing Problems}
%
If nothing shows when you open a €.dvi€ file, it may be because 
somehow you have zoomed in on an area off the printed page.
Try to use `File{\down}Default Scale' to reset the scale to 
something more reasonable. 

%% What if nothing appears on screen when you launch DVIWindo?
If {\DVIWindo} does not show up on screen when you launch it,
then the screen position and scale recorded in €dviwindo.ini€ 
may have been corrupted somehow.  
% but it does show up in the Task Manager list...

all lines referring to `Size' and `Mapping'
(by adding a semicolon (;) at the  beginning of the line).

%% comment out Size, Mapping, NotFirstSize, NotFirstMapping ?

If you get grey blocks, colored fonts, or other strange things when 
you are not expecting them, then your `Preferences' may have gotten 
warped in some peculiar way.
Use `File{\down}Factory Defaults' to temporarily reset preferences 
to their `out of the box' states.

If your `rules' (rectangular blocks such as division lines) look 
`too thick' at normal scale, or appear outlined as opposed to filled 
when magnified, then make sure to check

% \subsect{Memory Problems}
\subsect{Memory Problems and Sharing Violations}
%
If you get a memory allocation error % every time 
when you attempt to run \yandytex,
then you probably have too little {\it free\/} extended {\RAM}
(a very rare problem these days).
\yandytex\ needs at least 2~Meg of free extended {\RAM} when it runs
--- more for ini-{\TeX}, when using many fonts, or when using complex formats.

% If you don't have much {\RAM}, % but do have a lot of hard disk space, 
% you should set up a large permanent swap file. 
%
% In the `Main' program group, choose `Control Panel,' then `386 Enhanced,'
% then `Virtual Memory.'  
% Then make the largest permanent swap file you can
% (You may need to defragment your hard disk first, since otherwise
% the size of the permanent swap file may be limited by available
% contiguous space on your hard disk).
% Click on `Start' and then select `Settings{\down}Control Panel'
% Double click on `System,' then select the `Performance' tab.
% Under advanced settings, click on `Virtual Memory'.

If you get intermittent allocation errors, 
% then you are probably running \TeX\ 
% from inside Windows and
then you may have too many other windows open --- or you've
been using ill-behaved programs that don't return all the system resources
they use upon termination. 
In the first case, simply close some windows; 
in the second, there is nothing to do but exit and relaunch Windows.
%  --- although there is a shareware program called
% Hogs that can reallocate system resources.

Sharing violations and `€permission denied€' errors 
% and sharing violations
% and errors related to stack overflow ?
are usually caused by attempting to open a file
already open in another application.
Unfortunately some applications keep files open % that % you are working on

%
% flush the following maybe ?
%
% Ghostscript is a big offender; if you have opened €test.ps€ in
% Ghost\-script and try to rerun {\DVIPSONE} on €test.dvi€, you will get a
% €Sharing violation€ message. If you are using Ghostscript to debug
% Post\-Script code, note that you must close Ghostscript every time there's 
% an error before you can recreate a €.ps€ file with the same name.
%
Some Windows editors like Write and Micro\-Soft Word
prevent other programs from using files they have open.  
Others, like `Notepad,' `WinEdt,' {\PFE}, and Epsilon, 
do not present such problems.

You may also on rare occasions get a benign sharing violation error
if {\DVIWindo} happens to refresh the display just at the {\it exact\/}
moment that {\TeX} is trying to write a new €.dvi€ file.

\subsect{Environment and Preferences Problems}
%
If {\DVIWindo} begins to behave strangely, it may be that the file
€dviwindo.ini€ (in the €\windows€ 
folder) file has become corrupted. 
First try using `File{\down}Factory Defaults.'
If this does not help, exit {\DVIWindo}, 
make a backup copy of  €dviwindo.ini€,
then remove the whole €[Window]€ section from  €dviwindo.ini€.
% rename €dviwindo.ini€ to, say,
% €dviwindo.ibk€ (you will need this later), and relaunch.
% If {\DVIWindo} cannot find its €.ini€ file upon launch, % then 
% it will build a new one. 
{\DVIWindo} will rebuild the €[Window]€ section next time it is launched.

If you can't find the €.dvi€ file you created, check whether there is an
environment variable called €TEXDVI€.  Remove it.
If you want all €.dvi€ files to be written into a common directory, 
then add a  €WorkingDirectory€ entry 
to the €[Window]€ section of €dviwindo.ini€.

% WorkingDirectory=nul special case?

% discuss confusion when viewing 

If your preview doesn't seem to change after you edit and re-{\TeX} a file,
then maybe you have {\it two\/} copies of the €.dvi€ file in two different
places and you are looking at one, while {\TeX} is writing the other!
In this case you won't see {\DVIWindo} refreshing the screen.

Some problems will occur simply because the environment variables have been
set up incorrectly --- or more typically because you've changed something
without changing these variables. 
%
If, for instance, \TeX\ complains that it can't find a {\it file} 
the first thing to do is to look at the environment variables in
€dviwindo.ini€ --- particularly €TEXINPUTS€
(or rather the corresponding `format specific' environment variable).

If \TeX\ complains that it can't find a {\it font\/} 
the first thing to do is to look at the environment variables in
€dviwindo.ini€ --- particularly €TEXFONTS€
(or rather the corresponding `encoding specific' environment variable).

This sort of thing often happens when you start using a new macro package ---
\AmSLaTeX, say --- and you forget that you have to include the relevant 
folder in your €TEXINPUTS€ variable
(or rather the appropriate `format specific' €LATEX€ variable).

Another environment problem occurs when {\DVIWindo} can't find {\DVIPSONE}.
In this case the `Use DVIPSONE' check box is greyed out in the `Print'
dialog box.  To solve this problem, set the environment variable 
€PREPATH€ % (or €VECPATH€) 
to point to the {\DVIPSONE} folder. % directory.

%% also discuss problems due to `format specific' TEXINPUTS...

% If changes you make to €TEXINPUTS€ have no effect on what
% folders % directories 
% {\TeX} searches then you may have `format specific'
% environment variables that override €TEXINPUTS€
% (e.g. €LATEX€ is used for {\LaTeXe} instead).

Sometimes you want files output by {\TeX} to appear in the
same directory as the source file that {\TeX} is reading,
even though you have set up a €WorkingDirectory€.
This happens particularly when creating new `formats.'
In this case you may want to temporarily uncheck 
% `Fonts{\down}Working Directory.'
`Special{\down}Working Directory.'

There are many share- and freeware fonts that, simply, will not work with

Also, some TrueType versions of the Computer Modern fonts are incorrectly

every left page left by -82 pts, and every right page right by 78 pts.
% right page to the right and left page to the left by 82 pts and
% all pages up 17 pts. 

% For this manual, we used €dvipsone -x=112 manual€ followed by €twoup
% -m=1.545454124 -y=-109 -g -d=top.ps€ and €twoup -m=1.545454124 -y=-109 -h
% -d=bot.ps€ 
% (in \TeX, we set €\hsize=26pc€, €\vsize=502pt€,
% €\hoffset=-3pc€, and €\voffset=-2.5pc€). 
% Then we send €top.ps€ to
% our printer, take the output pages and place them in the input tray, and
% print €bot.ps€. 
% Then we send €top.ps€ to our printer, take the output pages and place
% them in the input tray, and print €bot.ps€. 
For % printing on 
an HP LJ 4M Plus printer, we also use the flags 
€-vzgr€ on the first run of {\TWOUP},
take output pages and place them face {\it up\/} in the input tray, 
and then run {\TWOUP} again with flags €-vzh€.
For printing on a QMS PS 815 MR printer
we leave out the €r€ in €-vzgr€ and place the pages facing {\it down}.
In either case, the result is, as you see, a correctly ordered manual
printed on both sides of 8\onehalf"\times11" paper. 
% $8{1\over2}\times11$ paper.

%%% remove SERIAL ?

% \subsect{Serial}
%
% If you have an older Post\-Script printer connected to a serial port that does
% not use hardware flow control, you may have to use software flow control with
% {\SERIAL}.
%
% This utility may also be useful if you need to read information sent back
% over the serial port by the Post\-Script interpreter in the printer.
% Example: 
% €serial -d=COM1€ \angi{filename}.
%
% Note: {\SERIAL} cannot be used in Windows~NT
% since it directly accesses the serial port hardware.

% DOWNLOAD

\subsect{TIFFTAGS and WMFSPY}
%
{\TIFFTAGS} can be used to dump out the `tags' in a 
`Tagged Image File Format' ({\TIFF}) file.
If you use the €-v€ command line flag you will get all tags,
including number of rows and columns, bits per sample, samples per pixel
and so on.
Without the €-v€ on the command line,
{\TIFFTAGS} shows only basic size information.
This is useful in reserving space in a {\TeX} document for a figure 
% to be 
inserted using the €\special{insertimage: ...}€ syntax).

{\WMFSPY} can be used to recover the header information in a 
placeable Windows Meta File ({\WMF}).
This is useful in reserving space in a {\TeX} document for a figure 
% to be 
inserted using the €\special{insertmf: ...}€ syntax).

%%% remove PKtoPS ? 

\subsect{PKTOPS}
%
{\PKtoPS} creates a Type 3 % (bitmapped) Post\-Script 
PS font file from a €.pk€ bitmapped font. %% define ?
This is not particularly
recommended, since you must either create the Post\-Script font
from a high-resolution €.pk€ file (1000 dpi or better), or live with
low-resolution fonts mixed in among your outline fonts. However, some fonts
exist only in €.pk€ form. Example: €pktops manfnt€. This creates a
file called €manfnt.ps€ in the current folder. % directory.

Note that {\DVIWindo} {\it cannot\/} display Type 3 fonts. 
If you use a lot of them, you will want to turn off 
`Complain Missing Fonts' and `Complain Bad Encoding' 
in the `Preferences\ellipsis' menu.

% The following may be a bit long ...99/July/26

\subsect{Decode}
%
{\DECODE} reaches inside €.pfb€, % €.pfa€, 
€.pfm€, and €.tfm€ files to see what encoding is in use. 
For instance, to check whether or not Times-Roman is set up
properly to use the % €texnansi€ 
{\TEXNANSI} encoding, run the following commands:

% (in the €\psfonts€ directory, or wherever you keep your €.pfb€ files)
% (in the €\psfonts\pfm€ subdirectory or equivalent)
% (in the €\yandytex\tfm€ subdirectory, or wherever you keep your €.tfm€ files)

\beginlines
€decode c:\psfonts\tir€ 
€     € The resulting text should end with the two lines:
€Adobe Standard Encoding€
€(which means ATM will reencode to Windows ANSI!)€
\endlines

\beginlines
€decode c:\psfonts\pfm\tir€ 
€     € This should indicate Windows {\ANSI} encoding, ending with:
€Hence probably Windows {\ANSI} if a plain text font€
€EncodingScheme (based on flags):  MS Windows ANSI€
\endlines

\beginlines
€decode c:\yandy\fonts\tfm-ps\tir€ 
€     € This should indicate {\TEXNANSI} encoding:
€Claims to use `TeX typewriter and Windows ANSI' coding scheme€
€Claims to use `texnansi' encoding vector€
\endlines

% €decode c:\yandytex\tfm\tir€ 

\noindent
(in the above, substitute the folders % directories 
you use for €.pfb€,  €.pfm€, and €.tfm€ files respectively).
The result of the last test will be different, of course, 
if you use some encoding other than {\TEXNANSI}. % €texnansi€.

The above is the usual result for Type~1 {\it text\/} fonts. 
If you have a font (like Symbol or Zapf Dingbats) that is {\it not\/} a text
font, then you may want to have access to the €.afm€ file, as follows:

\beginlines
€decode -a=c:\psfonts\afm\zd c:\psfonts\zd€
€     € Result should be:  €Encoding seems to match that in AFM file€
\endlines

\beginlines
€decode -a=c:\psfonts\afm\zd c:\psfonts\pfm\zd€
€     € Result should indicate `FontSpecific' encoding, ending with:
€Hence probably Font Specific unless its a text font€
€EncodingScheme (based on flags): FontSpecific€
\endlines

\noindent 
Because of the wild differences in the kind of information in 
the different types of font files,
% each type of file, 
{\DECODE} may sometimes be unable to express an opinion.
If you have doubts about the kind of encodings in the various files,
reinstall the fonts from their original disk, and recreate the €.tfm€ file
(In rare cases you may {\it also\/} need to delete {\ATM}'s
`Quick Load Cache' file €atmfonts.qlc€ in the €\psfonts€
folder). % directory). % in order purge old metrics).

%% flush following ??? highly optional

% \subsub{Page selection}
\subsub{Selecting more than one page range to print}
%
% Page selection 
You can select a subrange of pages when printing from {\DVIWindo},
% You can, however, select
but only one range at a time:
% It is, however, not possible to select more than one range at a time;
you have to print each subrange separately.

% Well, if the pages are in a single range (380--399, say), you can fill in 
% {\DVIWindo}'s `Print' dialog box. 
% If you have several ranges, then you can do this several times.
%
% However, there are % three 
% some possibilities:

% \nlist
% \item Type several long command lines, being very, very careful not to make
% any typos. 
% \item Create a batch file to contain the various long command lines.

% \item Use €dvipsone.cmd€, an auxiliary file that can contain command-line
% parameters and arguments. However, you must then be careful to delete (or
% comment out) the page-selection commands after you're done, lest every job be
% limited to those pages.  \endlist

You can select more than one subrange if you use {\DVIPSONE} 
directly from the command line. % {\DOS} prompt. 
%
The page-selection commands for {\DVIPSONE} are
€-b=€\angi{starting page number} 
€-e=€\angi{ending page number}, 
where the page number refers to €\count0€, the register plain \TeX\ and
\LaTeX\ use to create page numbers, 
or alternatively 
€-B=€\angi{starting page number}
€-E=€\angi{ending page number}, 
where the page number refers to the
physical count within the €.dvi€ file. 

You cannot mix lower- and uppercase page-selection commands.
The command line arguments €-b=...€ and €-e=...€ may appear
several times to specify several different page ranges
%
(If you use a batch file to call {\DVIPSONE}, 
you will be restricted to ten command line arguments).

%%% flush this detail ?

% Selection of pages when printing many subranges can get a bit involved,
% however, especially since {\DOS} limits the length of the command line 
% to 128 bytes. 
% So what do you do if you want to print 20 miscellaneous pages of a 
% 400-page €.dvi€ file?   

% One method is to create a file called
% €dvipsone.cmd€ in the €\dvipsone€ directory.
% This file is read by {\DVIPSONE} when it starts and scanned for additional
% command line arguments.
% You can enter the full command line into this file.
% Just make sure to delete the file again afterwards.
% % (or it will be interpreted every time you call {\DVIPSONE}.

%%% remove Font Manipulation Package for the moment ?

\subsect{Font Manipulation Package (Advertisement)}
%
% If you cannot get the results you want with {\AFMtoTFM} --- or 
If you have special needs not met by simply reencoding a font ---
such as making new fonts by combining glyphs from two existing fonts
% like a desire to typeset in a non-Latin alphabet
--- then you may find it convenient to purchase {\yandy}'s 
Font Manipulation Package
(\FMP), which contains command line % {\DOS} 
utilities for modifying Type~1 font files
without damaging their `hinting' --- which is crucial to quality rendering.

The {\FMP} includes utilities for inserting characters from one
font in another, for adding new accented characters, 
for adjusting character side-bearings and advance widths,
for applying arbitrary linear transformation to glyphs,
% and more\dots
and more\ellipsis

% following is somewhat optional (was end of environment var section)

% Changing environment variables using batch file:

% Sometimes it is convenient to change environment variables when working on
% different projects.  This may be done using a batch file. 
% A batch file, however, cannot modify €dviwindo.ini€.
% In this case, do {\it not\/} list the environment variables you want to be
% able to change in the `[Environment]' section of €dviwindo.ini€, 
% so that corresponding {\DOS} environment variable will be used instead. 

% download, modex

\subsub{Font substitution file}
%
% In most cases you % do not need to
Typically you need not worry about font substitution in {\DVIPSONE}.
The standard substitution file is called €standard.sub€. 
It simply ensures that fonts already present on your printer 
will not be downloaded as part of the Post\-Script file.

If the fonts resident on your printer do not match the basic 13 --- 
namely the Times-Roman, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol families ---
% (if you have more or less), 
then you may want to edit €standard.sub€ or,
better, create your own substitution file.
You can tell {\DVIPSONE} to use a different substitution file using
€-s=mysub.sub€ on the command line.
%
By the way, any such command line arguments that you want to
always have {\DVIPSONE} use can be placed in
a €dvipsone.cmd€ file in your €DVIPSONE€ folder. % directory.
%
If {\DVIPSONE} is called from {\DVIWindo} then an alternative is,
as indicated before, to add a €DVIPSONE=...€ entry to the
`€[Window]€' section of €dviwindo.ini€.
Printer-resident fonts are entered in the substitution file as follows: 

\beginlines
€tir Times-Roman *force* *reside*€
\endlines

\noindent 
The standard 13 fonts are given in €standard.sub€; if your
printer includes additional fonts, you will have to add additional lines. 
The first element in each line is the % {\DOS} 
filename, less underscores and
extensions; the second element is the Post\-Script FontName (note that this is
{\it not\/} the `Face Name' used in Windows menus!), the last two elements
€*force* *reside*€ tell {\DVIPSONE} not to download the font, but rather
to assume that it is present on the printer.

% more general put this elsewhere ?

% also mention can call for more than one font substitution file

Note that if you claim a font is resident and turn out to be wrong, all
instances of that font in your document will be ``Couriered out''; any time a
Post\-Script device is asked for a font it can't find it blithely substitutes
the Courier font.
% (even though it is very difficult to imagine a situation in
% which this would be the right thing to do).  

You can ask {\DVIPSONE} to check whether all the required fonts are present
on the printing device by using the command line flag €-*s€.  
If any fonts are missing, it then list the missing fonts on an error page
instead of printing the job.

Several other useful font substitution files may be found in the
€\sub€ subfolder % subdirectory 
of the €\dvipsone€ folder. % directory.

% If your file uses, say, €msbm6€ and you only have €msbm7€ and
% €msmb10€, then you'll have to create substitution lines in
% €standard.sub€ (or whatever substitution file you're using). 
% In this case, the line would be, % simply

% \beginlines
% €msbm6 msbm7€
% \endlines

% \noindent or you can use €amsfonts.sub€ --- or add it to your €.sub€
% file; it contains this line and many others.

% flush the following ?

A word of warning, though --- if you have previously modified % edited 
your fonts in order to get around encoding % these 
problems (using, for example, the €encode.bat€ batch file), 
you will have a fair amount of work to do in order to make your 
setup % system
compatible with this new feature.
Of course, you {\it can\/} continue to use the modified fonts, 
just remember that they will not be reencoded `on the fly' to the encoding
specified by the % environment 
variable €ENCODING€.
%
If you {\it do\/} want to convert them to the `new way' of doing things,
% have edited font files, 
replace the font files with their original versions ---
making sure to change {\it both\/} the €.pfb€ and €.pfm€ files back.
% (If the €.pfb€ and €.pfm€ files do not match, then {\ATM} will
% probably refuse to display the font.)


% maybe flush this

\subsub{Font Downloading}
%
{\DVIPSONE} is a Post\-Script printer driver unique in several respects.
For example, it is the only printer driver using `partial font downloading,'
which greatly reduces the size of the file sent to the printer
and also greatly reduces the amount of virtual memory used on the printer.
%
Because of {\DVIPSONE}'s partial font downloading, there will usually not be
any need to download fonts to your printer's virtual memory. 

Downloading fonts is sometimes called ``permanent'' downloading because the
downloaded font can then be used in more than one job.  However, if the
printer is reinitialized, the ``permanently'' downloaded fonts disappear.
% and will have to be downloaded again.

% do we want to waste a lot of space on this ?

Adobe provides downloading utilities with their Type~1 fonts. €pcsend€
works % well 
from the % {\DOS} 
command line; there is also a Windows program,
Adobe Font Downloader. In addition, €download€ is provided with
{\DVIPSONE}. No matter which you use, however, {\it you\/} must manually edit
your font substitution file to ensure that your printer and {\DVIPSONE} agree
on which fonts are downloaded. It is extremely easy to get them out of
sync --- and you won't find out they're out of sync until you start seeing
Courier all over your print job.

% FLUSH THIS ???

\subsub{Upgrade Blues}
%
If you previously used \yandy's utilities to reencode your €.pfb€,
€.pfm€ files % (and thus your €.pfm€ and €.tfm€ files), 
and €.tfm€ files,
then you will have to either undo the reencoding or (which is likely to be
{\it much\/} easier) reinstall the fonts from the original diskettes. 
Remember that only the €.afm€ file has {\it all\/} the metric information.
% If you no longer have the original €.afm€ file, you will shortly learn
% why you were advised to keep a backup copy. 
%
% (However, Adobe says that ``in a few weeks'' [as of June 1995] €.afm€
% files will be available on their ftp site: 
% €ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/Fonts€.)

If you do not have the {\AFM} file, you can recreate it 
% to recreate an €.afm€ file, you can 
using {\TFMtoAFM} or {\PFMtoAFM} % €tfmtoafm€ or €pfmtoafm€ 
(which give different character bounding box sizes, no composite-character
information, and no unencoded character information, but do give the kerning
information).

If you have the `Font Manipulation Package' (see later) %% section?
you can also use {\PFAtoAFM} (which gives % reasonably 
accurate character bounding box sizes, composite-character information, and
unencoded character information, though no kerning information). 
In this case you can replace the `CharMetrics' section of an
€.afm€ file made using {\TFMtoAFM} or {\PFMtoAFM}
with the more accurate one made using {\PFAtoAFM}.

% Combine the resulting files into a single €.afm€
% file, reencode it to StandardEncoding, and 
In any case create new €.pfm€ and €.tfm€ files
using {\AFMtoPFM} and {\AFMtoTFM}. 
Note that The €.pfm€ file should be created with €-c=ansinew€; 
the €.tfm€ file should be created with an encoding vector of your choice
(for example `texnansi').

{\bf Important}: Do not simply copy over your old €.pfb€ and €.pfm€
file with the new one. 
First, remove the old font using Adobe Type Manager's {\ATM} Control Panel.  
Place the newly restored €.pfb€ and €.pfm€ files in some
temporary folder % directory 
and install the font from there using {\ATM}.
% Then copy the new €.pfm€ into your €pfm€ folder % directory 
% and add the font through the {\ATM} Control Panel. 
%
In some cases you will need in addition to exit Windows, delete the 
file €atmfonts.qlc€ in your €psfonts€ folder, % directory, 
and relaunch Windows to have {\ATM} reconstruct its `Quick Load Cache.'

{\bf Important}: {\TeX} format files contain `frozen' {\TFM} files.
If a format contains a {\TFM} file for a font, {\TeX} will never
notice that you may have changed it on the disk.  This can lead
to mysterious problems, for which recreation of the format file
is the solution.  You can check which {\TFM} files
{\TeX} is reading by using the command line flag €-Z€ with
\yandytex.  The log file then will show all {\TFM} files read.

% following was in `Problems' section

% following seems highly optional...
Another easy way to get \TeX\ confused is to port someone else's files to
your system and attempt to duplicate the original file and folder % directory
structure and environment on your machine. If you have set up €TEXAUX€ to
point to a single folder % directory 
and the original setup assumes that €.aux€
files will be distributed throughout a tree of folders, % directory tree, 
you have the makings of a nice snafu. 
The solution to such a case is to turn off €TEXAUX€
(that is, simply delete it from %  --- or comment it out in 
€dviwindo.ini€).

% following seems somewhat optional (like SysSeg)

\subsect{Cleanup} 
%
{\CLEANUP} allows you to conveniently close all {\DOS} windows you have kept
open (so that, for instance, you can see the results of a \TeX\ run). To keep
{\DOS} windows open, simply {\it uncheck\/} the box `Close Window on Exit' in
the {\PIF} Editor.
