Compatibility Trouble Shooting Information
==========================================

The Computer Modern fonts in Type 1 format are fully hinted
Adobe Type 1 fonts.  In addition, these fonts are Adobe Type Manager
compatible (to be ATM compatible a Type 1 font must obey an additional 
set of rules beyond the Type 1 rules).

These fonts will work with any Adobe PostScript printer interpreter,
as well as with Adobe Type Manager in Windows (and on the MacIntosh,
when converted to MacIntosh outline font format).  They also work 
with most `clone' interpreters.

There are however, some applications and some PS interpreters that make
unwarranted assumptions about the Type 1 format (to put it politely):

Corel Draw 2.0:
===============

Corel Draw's WFNBOSS has a number of problems in reading of Type 1 fonts.  
One such problem is that WFNBOSS insists that lines in the ASCII section of a
font be separated by `return' (the line terminator on the Mac), instead of
`newline' (which is the PostScript line terminator).  The CM fonts have
been modified so that the ASCII section uses `return' instead of `newline'
(since this change appears not to cause any problem with other clones). 

Corel Draw's WFNBOSS has a number of problems also in writing of Type 1 fonts.
These include CharString entries without names, which may crash some PS
interpreters.  Also there some character outlines are lost in conversion.
And, of course, there are no hints.  A Type 1 font read into WFNBOSS and then
written out again has lost a great deal of its quality.  And non-standard font
encoding may present problems.

Micrografx Designer 3.1
=======================

This version of Designer assumes that all fonts start at character code 32
(that is, there are no characters with codes in the range 0 - 31). If a font
starts with character code zero (as the CM fonts do), then all character
metric information will be shifted by 32 positions.  It is possible to work
around this by making up modified PFM files that use the remapping present
in these fonts.  Specify the `t' and `y' command line arguments when running
AFMtoPFM on the Computer Modern AFM files.

The PFM files distributed with the CM fonts have not been modified in
this way for a number of reasons, one of which is that this modification
triggers a problem in ATM 2.0 (!)

Newer releases of Designer appear not to have this problem.

`Clone' PostScript interpreters:
================================

PostScript interpreters developed by Adobe have only two serious bugs
(one false `invalidfont' bug and one false `invalidrestore' bug), and
these are now well documented.  PostScript interpreters developed
independently often have very many bugs, although most don't show up
with ordinary use.  Such interpreters may work quite well on plain
vanialla text fonts from Adobe, since this is what they were debugged
on.  But text fonts from Adobe were all produced by the same software
and hence have exactly the same internal structure.  So being able to
interpret these is no guarantee that all valid Type 1 fonts can be handled.

Many PostScript interpreters do not properly implement the Type 1
specification.  We include a series of test files in directory PS
on diskette C that may help pin down problems with you printer or
software PostScript interpreter.  This numbered series of test files
includes increasingly more complex material.  Knowing which tests
fail will help pin down what the problem is.  See the `readme.txt'
file in that directory for additional details.

NewGen TurboPS printers:
========================

The older NewGen interpreters have several defects.  One that presents a
serious problem for users of the Computer Modern fonts is that these
interpreters cannot handle character widths that are not integer multiples of
1/1000-th of an `em'.  Contact us for modified versions of the fonts that
will run on NewGen interpreters.  The above applies to the
NewGen 480 TurboPS.  New interpreters from NewGen do not have this problem.

LaserMaster 1000
================

The interpreter in this printer also has some problems in Type 1
interpretation. For example, it cannot handle 32 bit numbers in the
Type 1 font program.  The CM fonts have been modified to work
around these problems.  The fonts should work on this printer without
any further changes.

ATM 2.0:
========

ATM for Windows has several shortcomings (generally a weaker product
than ATM for the MacIntosh).  For example, ATM for Windows cannot handle
multiply encoded characters (where two character codes map to the same
character program). 

Also, ATM 2.0 has introduced the `invisible ink' rendering problem,
where fonts that have multiple encodings will intermittently cause
all on-screen rendering from ATM to cease.  Most `invisible ink'
problems have been solved in ATM 2.6 for Windows.  

Please get the latest version of ATM from Adobe.

Software PostScript previewers:
==============================

Many programs for previewing PostScript (as opposed to Display PostScript)
either cannot handle Type 1 fonts, or have poor rendering of characters 
(in comparison say to Adobe Type Manager).  Some also can only handle plain
vanilla Adobe Type 1 text fonts, and most ignore the hints in the fonts.

DVIPS:
======

Older versions of DVIPS cannot handle fonts with repeated encoding.

Please get the latest version of DVIPS!

Some NewGen printers to not permit redefinition of font metrics once
a character has been rendered.  This affects a scheme used by DVIPS
to redefined character widths to rounded values, and results in uneven
spacing when DVIPS is used with such printers.
