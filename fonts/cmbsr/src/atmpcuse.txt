CM outline fonts, Windows 3.0 applications and Adobe Type Manager:
==================================================================

The PC versions of the Blue Sky Research Adobe Type 1 outline fonts
for Computer Modern come on three diskettes.  These contain the actual
character outlines (.pfb files), the Windows font metric files (.pfm
files), Adobe font metric files (.afm files), and a few utility
programs.  The Adobe font metric files are not used by Adobe Type
Manager (ATM), but are provided for use with other applications, such
as programs that generate metric files in other formats from Adobe
font metric files (like Y&Y's AFMTOTFM and AFMTOPFM).

You may be using these fonts with an application that has its own
installation procedure, and so the following may not apply.  For
example, for use with Y&Y's DVIPSONE, you simple copy all of the .pfb
files to some convenient directory (c:\psfonts say) on your hard disk.
But if you plan to use these fonts with Windows applications (such as
MicroSoft Word for Windows, Aldus PageMaker, Micrografix Designer, or
Y&Y's DVIWindo) then read on!

To install the outline fonts for use with MicroSoft Windows 3.0 and
Adobe Type Manager (ATM), insert one of the diskette containing .pfb
and .pfm files into a diskette drive.  Launch Windows 3.0 and double
click on the ATM icon.  Install the desired fonts from the ATM control
menu.  You can select several fonts at once by holding down the control
key while clicking on fontnames.  Repeat using the second diskette.
(Note that the newly installed fonts will not be accessible to Windows
applications until you exit and relaunch Windows.)

During the installation process, the .pfb font files will be copied to
the directory c:\psfonts, while the .pfm files will be copied to
c:\psfonts\pfm (assuming ATM uses the default directories).  The
installation procedure also adds softfont entries to each section
of your win.ini file designated for a PostScript printer (If you
later add another PostScript printer, you will need to copy the
softfont entries into the corresponding section of win.ini).

By the way, removing a font using ATM unfortunately does NOT remove the
corresponding entry from win.ini.  Consequently, if you remove a font
using ATM, use a text editor to remove all related softfont entries in
win.ini.  If this is not done, duplicate entries may appear later when
the font is reinstalled.  Actually, to install a new version of a font,
it is easier to simply replace the .pfb file in c:\psfonts and the pfm
file in c:\psfonts\pfm with the new versions (If you do, delete the
file atmfonts.qlc in the c:\psfonts directory---ATM will rebuilt it the
next time you launch Windows).

If you would like to check on what fonts are actually installed, double
click the ATM icon.  Alternatively, look in the file atm.ini in your
Windows directory.  Each line of this file gives the Windows name of a
font and both the .pfb and .pfm file names (as well as whether the font
is considered BOLD or ITALIC---or both).

Downloading fonts:
-----------------

Fonts can be either downloaded manually (i.e. permanently) or
automatically (i.e. only for the duration of a particular print job).
Fonts that are downloaded manually remain resident in the printer until
the printer is rebooted or power cycled.  Usually applications using
outline fonts come with utilities for downloading.  You can, for example,
use one of the Adobe downloader (PCSEND for serial ports or PSDOWN for
parallel ports) to preload the CM fonts you plan to use.  The utility
DOWNLOAD that comes with DVIPSONE is also supplied with these fonts for
downloading of fonts.  To see what command line arguments it takes, invoke
it using `download -?'.

Fonts downloaded `manually' are treated exactly like printer resident fonts.
Note, however, that typically only a handful of fonts can be downloaded
before a significant portion of the printers virtual memory (VM) is used up. 

There is thus an advantage to `automatic' downloading.  To provide for
automatic downloading of a particular font, you need to make a small
change in the file win.ini in your Windows directory.  Simply extend
the softfont entry in win.ini with the path to the .pfb file.  So, for
example, change:

	softfont29=c:\psfonts\pfm\cmr10.pfm
to
	softfont29=c:\psfonts\pfm\cmr10.pfm,c:\psfonts\cmr10.pfb

where it has been assumed that the .pfb font file has been copied
to the directory c:\psfonts.

(Note: there should be no space after the comma above, and the order of
entries should be as shown.  Also remember that there is a softfont entry
for every printer you have installed in Windows, so this alteration may
need to be made in more than one place in win.ini)

FontName case:
--------------

The PostScript `FontName's of these CM fonts are all upper case, in order
to be consistent with the MacIntosh versions, where font name contraction
would cause lower case names to become non-unique.  Most applications,
such as DVIPSONE, actually don't care what the FontName is.  If you
download the font to the printer, however, then there has to be a match
between the PostScript FontName and that called for by the application.  
A utility called NAMECASE is provided with these fonts that will change the
case of Fontname in a PFB file so that fonts can be used with applications
that expect lowercase fontnames.  To see what command line arguments it
takes, invoke it using `namecase -?'. Alternatively, convert the PFB file to
PFA format, change the case of FontName, and convert back to PFB format.

Character Encoding:
------------------

Alphanumeric characters can be accessed just by typing the appropriate
key, of course, but Computer Modern fonts also contain many special
characters that are located in `control-character' positions.
Unfortunately, you can't effectively use the codes between 0 and 31 in
most Windows applications, so these have been remapped to positions
161--195 (see the table below).  Also, note that TeX uses character
code 32 for Polish ``suppress'' or ``cancel''---to get a real space,
use character code 160.

Many Windows applications (like PageMaker) do use the kerning
information in the .pfm files (although you may have to set the point
size above which kerning is to be used).  Unfortunately, however,
Windows applications cannot deal with ligatures, because the .pfm file
format does not provide for ligature information.  To get the ligatures
commonly used in TeX, you will need to use numeric codes derived from
the table below (e.g. ff is 174, fi is 175, and fl is 176).

To gain access to the codes above 127 in Windows applications, hold down the
ALT key, type 0 and then the (decimal) code number  (If you do not type the
leading 0, IBM OEM encoding is used, which is typically not what you want).
This table gives the mapping of characters in the `control character'
positions:
