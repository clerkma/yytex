*	Computer Modern style fonts -
*	with accented and composite characters - 
*	in ATM compatible Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) format -
*	useable with TeX as well as other applications.


Background and Motivation:

The European Modern (EM) font set consists of 57 text fonts that are
vastly extended versions of Computer Modern (CM) text fonts.  Each EM text
font contains 310 glyphs compared to the 128 in CM text fonts (of which
eleven are upright Greek letters).  Each EM text font has over 90 accented
characters, including the 58 `standard' ones found in most fonts in Type 1
format.  

*	Having ready-made accented/composite glyphs in the font makes it
*	possible to achieve proper hyphenation when using TeX in languages
*	that use accented characters.  This is not possible when using
*	Computer Modern (CM) fonts.

Of course, proper hyphenation is already possible when using text fonts
other than CM that have a suitable complement of accented characters, but
the EM font set brings the `CM look.'  And --- unlike the bitmapped EC/T1
fonts --- this font set is in scalable outline format.  It also contains
only 57 text fonts --- compared to the 565 fonts in the EC set.


EM math fonts and CM math fonts:

The EM font set covers text and math italic. This is augmented with CM
math fonts for math symbols and math extension.  Consequently, the EM font
set also includes the CMEX*, CMSY* and CMBSY* fonts.

For math italic one uses EMMI* and EMMIB* (in place of CMMI* and CMMIB*).
The reason there are separate EM math italic fonts, is that CM math fonts
do not contain upright upper case Greek.  When using CM, the upright upper
case Greek characters are obtained from the CM *text* fonts.  In order to
avoid having to use the CM text fonts, the eleven required characters have
been imported into the EMMI* and EMMIB* math italic fonts.  (While the EM
text fonts do in fact contain the Greek letters, it is undesirable to have
to compromise the font encoding in order to gain access to these glyphs).

EM text fonts are just that: text fonts.  They can be used with any encoding.
The encoding of these fonte are not hard-wired like the CM or the EC fonts.
Nor are these fonts limited to 256 glyphs (most contain 310).  The glyph
complement includes all characters in Cork (T1) encoding, TeX 'n ANSI (LY1)
encoding and Textures (LM1) encoding.  These fonts can be used with any
Macintosh application.


Installation:

The font files are supplied on five diskettes.  Use Adobe Type Manager 
(ATM) to install the fonts.  We recommend ATM Deluxe 4.0 (or on
older version of ATM plus SuitCase II).   You install the fonts like
any other fonts in Adobe Type 1 format.

TFM and AFM files may be found on the fourth and fifth diskette.  TFM 
files for these fonts are not unique, since text fonts can be arbitrarily
reencoded.  We provide one set for TeX 'n ANSI (LY1) encoding (subdirectory
texnansi), for Cork (T1) encoding (subdirectory tex256) and Textures (LM1)
encoding (subdirectory texmac).  We also include TFM files for Macintosh
standard roman encoding (subdirectpry mac).

Relationship to corresponding CM fonts:

The EM font set has equivalents for 55 text fonts in the 75 font CM set.
Note that there is no need for equivalents of the three CMTEX* fonts.
This is because these are mere encoding variants of the CMTT* fonts, in
the sense that glyphs with the same names are identical in shape in
corresponding CMTEX* and CMTT* fonts.  The only difference is that a
CMTEX* font has a few glyphs not found in the corresponding CMTT* font and
vice versa.  The extra glyphs found in CMTEX* have been absorbed into the
corresponding EMTT* fonts.  They can be made accessible by reencoding
these fonts, if desired.

Similarly, CMINCH is just a different size of CMSSBX10 with fewer glyphs.  
Use EMSSBX10 at 72.27pt to get the equivalent of CMINCH (with more glyphs).

The reason there are 57 EM text fonts rather than 55 is that equivalents
of two AMS text fonts (smaller sizes of the smallcaps face) are also
included, for convenience.

In addition, the math fonts supplied with the EM font set include the
extra sizes of the CM math bold fonts found in the AMS font set, not in
the CM set.  This includes extra `in between' sizes not previously
available in Type 1 format.

Note that in the math fonts supplied here - both the math italic and the
math symbol fonts - have been revised following Knuths recommendations.


Plain TeX, LaTeX 2.09 Support:

Support for the fonts under plain TeX, LaTeX 2.09 may be found on the
third diskette in folders `plain TeX' and `LaTeX 2.09'.  There are files
than can be \input on top of an existing CM-based format, as well as
source files for constructing a new EM-based format.


LaTeX 2e support:

LaTeX 2e support for the fonts may be found in the `LaTeX 2e' subdirectory. Add: 

\usepackage[LM1]{em} or  \usepackage[LY1]{em} or \usepackage[T1]{em}

to your LaTeX source after \documentclass{...} and before \begin{document}.
This will override the definitions for all the fonts and so the standard 
`fd' files are not invoked.  You will also need to tell LaTeX what text font 
encoding you are using:

\usepackage[LM1]{fontenc}	% for LM1 / Textures encoding
\usepackage[LY1]{fontenc}	% for LY1 / TeX 'n ANSI encoding
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}	% for T1  / Cork encoding

If you add this line *before* the ones calling for the `em' package,
then you can leave out the encoding option to that packages.
Additional information may be found in the file `em.txt'.


ATM problems with a few `non-standard' accented characters:

Some versions of ATM have problems with accented characters not found in the
Windows ANSI set. 

The problem shows up when the font is reencoded to expose accented characters
that use `breve,' `dotaccent,' or `hungarumlaut.'  These are accents that do
not occur in the standard 58 accented characters found in Adobe fonts. 

The versions of ATM affected by this bug pick the character in the
position of the accent in Adobe Standard Encoding (198, 199, 205) instead
of the actual accent.  If what appears at this character code is a simple
character, it will be shown instead of the accent.  If this character is a
composite character itself, nothing will be shown.


Using EM fonts with DVIPS:

For use with DVIPS you will need to specify in the psfonts.map file what
encoding you want to use.  We provide sample files, psfonts.emt for T1 (Cork)
encoding, psfonts.emy for LY1 (TeX 'n ANSI), and psfonts.emm for LM1
(Textures) encoding.  The math fonts use fixed encoding and so do not need to
be reencoded.

T1 encoding contains accented/composite glyphs used in Latin writing systems
of Western, Central and to some extent Eastern Europe.  LY1 and LM1 contain
accented glyphs for Western Europe only, but cover many typographically
important glyphs (like dagger and daggerdbl) for which there is no space in
T1 encoding.  The fonts can of course also be used with other encoding
schemes such as Macintosh standard roman encoding.

You also need to use the TFM files appropriate for the encoding you have
chosen.  We supply TFM files for the text fonts for T1 (in directory tex256),
LY1 (in directory texnansi), and LM1 (in directory texmac).  These TFM files
are complete with ligature and kerning information.  There is a single TFM
file per font.  

*	NOTE:  No need for `virtual fonts,' or multiple TFM files!


Special Features of EM when compared with CM:

The glyphs in EM fonts that come directly from CM fonts have the same 
shape and size, and generally the same advance width and metrics as the
corresponding glyphs in CM fonts.  There are a few exceptions:

(1) Proper subscript positioning with respect to upright upper case Greek
letters:  Since in the EM font set the upright upper case greek letters
come from a math font (EMMI*), the appropriate modifications to the glyphs
and the TFM file could be made to draw the subscript closer to the letter
in the case of overhanging glyphs like Gamma, Upsilon, and Psi.  This is
not possible in CM fonts, because these letters are there pulled from a
text font.

(2) Hanging hyphens:  The EM text fonts contain a second `hyphen' called
`sfthyphen' which is the same shape and size as the regular `hyphen' but
has half the width; as a result it `sticks out of the format' on the
right.  The `sfthyphen' appears at character code 127 in T1 encoding and
173 in LY1 encoding.  Setting the \defaulthyphenchar to the appropriate
value (as is done in em.sty) automatically generates hanging hyphens.  If
you prefer not to have hanging hyphens, just change the \defaulthyphenchar
back to 45.

(3) Minor corrections in some glyphs:  In some EM text fonts, the letter `s'
has slightly larger left side bearing, the letter `a' has slightly larger
right side bearing, while the letter `t' has slightly less on the right than 
the corresponding glyphs in CM.

(4) In some of the EM text fonts, the grave accent has been moved to the
right and the acute accent to the left to get better appearance of
ready-made accented letters.  Also, the circumflex is a bit lower and
a bit wider. The circumflex on `ecircumflex' has been moved a bit to the right.

(5) Minor corrections in some metric files: Some of the EM text fonts have a
negative kern for the pair `o j' --- unlike the corresponding CM text fonts
which incorrectly have a positive kern. The italic digit `7' has a near zero
depth --- unlike the corresponding CM text fonts where this glyph by mistake
has a depth equal to that of the old-style digit `4' (which hangs way below 
the base line).

(6) Kerning with respect to the `boundary' character: The quotation
characters in the CM fonts include extra side-bearings to separate the
quotation from the rest of the test.  This assumes that the `English'
opening and closing quotation convention is being used.  This is a serious
restrictions in some other languages where quotation marks are used
differently.  The extra side-bearing has been removed from the double
quotation characters.  Instead, suitable kern pairs with respect to the
`space' character have been introduced.  This works for quoteleft/right,
quotedblleft/right, quotedblbase and quotereversed.

(7) Kern pairs for accented characters: accented/composite characters
inherit the kern values from the corresponding base characters (except in
a few places where there are additional adjustments).
