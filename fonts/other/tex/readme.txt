============================
TeX Pi font LaTeX 2e support
============================

In this directory you will find a collection of *.sty and *.fd files 
for use with LaTeX 2e.  There are also *.ins and *.dtx files used
originally for generating these files.  

	However, do *NOT* run TeX on these *.ins files!

If you do, you will overwrite *.fd files that have been customized for use
with the scalable outline versions of these fonts.  These differ from the
corresponding *.fd files for the corresponding bitmapped PK font files.  
The main difference being that the *.fd files for the scalable fonts allow
use of the fonts at arbitrary point size.

You can - and should - run LaTeX on the *.dtx files to get the 
documentation for these LaTeX 2e packages.  You may also wish to
read the plain ASCII *.rme files describing two of the packages.
