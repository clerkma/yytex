1. (In)Compatibility Issues:
============================

NOTE: 	ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH DVIWINDO INSTALLATION:
	Central Point Anti-Virus appears to be incompatible with DVIWindo.
	Norton Anti-Virus may be incompatible with DVIWindo Setup (use /B).
	PC Tools DataMonitor version 7.1 may be a problem during installation.
	(The above sometimes also have problems with MicroSoft SMARTDRV).

NOTE: 	SOME DELETE-PROTECTION SOFTWARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH DVIWINDO:
	We have had reports that PC-Tools DataMonitor can cause crashes.
	DataMonitor also sometimes crashes Lugaru's Epsilon.
	Some other Delete-Protection software TSR's are also suspect.

NOTE:	SOME SCREEN-SAVERS CONSIDERED DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH:
	Several screen savers (other than those that come with Windows)
	causes mysterious random crashes.  They are cute, but not worth
	the wasted motion...

NOTE:	ALTERNATE PROGRAM MANAGERS MAY NOT ALLOW COMPLETE INSTALL:
	If you are using a substitute for Program Manager (WinDesk,
	Norton DeskTop etc.) then the automatic installation procedure
	for DVIWindo will probably not be able to set up the Y&Y program
	group and the DVIWindo icon, since it uses DDE to communicate 
	with the Program Manager.  In some cases alternate program
	managers may corrupt program groups for DVIWindo that you set up 
	if you already have an older version of DVIWindo installed.  
	Remove the old program groups first in that case. 

NOTE:	Windows 3.1 Hebrew version incompatible with ATM.  The place where
	ATM has to hook into Windows is different in this version of Windows
	(This may be fixed in a future release of Windows or ATM).

NOTE:	HP Omnibook incompatible with ATM.  This machine has Windows
	in ROM and so does not allow ATM to `hook' in properly.
	HP is planning an upgrade that will fix this, but keep in 
	mind that the machine will be limited to 6 Meg RAM total.

NOTE:	ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR FOR WINDOWS CANNOT RUN WITH OTHER APPLICATIONS:
	Adobe Illustrator for Windows appears to have some problems when
	running with other Windows applications.  You may find that if
	you load DVIWindo after AI is loaded you get `Unable to register
	custom control' from DVIWindo.  Conversely, if you load AI after
	loading DVIWindo you may get `ADOBEDLG.DLL not found' message from
	Adobe Illustrator. If this happens, just avoid running DVIWindo 
	and Adobe Illustrator at the same time for now.

	More seriously, all your fonts may disappear when you load AI!
	A work around is to FIRST load up Windows `Write' and type some 
	text in it.  Just keeping it around (even minimized) will prevent 
	AI from messing up the ATM font menu items (The same trick that 
	used to be used to speed up launch of Windows applications by 
	keeping the PS printer driver loaded --- before the PS driver 
	started	having its own cache of font metric information).

NOTE:	PROBLEMS WITH EPSF FILES GENERATED BY ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR:
	Adobe Illustrator (i) uses its own font enumerator in Windows,
	and (ii) reencodes fonts the way it wants.  This can lead to
	problems when you have reencoded fonts, and can lead to
	conflicts with other Windows programs which use Windows to
	enumerate fonts.  Amongst other things, AI uses the PostScript
	FontName where other Windows applications use the Windows Face Name.

NOTE:	PROBLEMS WITH EPSF FILES GENERATED BY ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR 6.0:
	These EPSF files have the amusing property that they do not
	work if you remove the comments (lines starting with %)!  
	The latest version of DVIPSONE avoids this optimization so will 
	be able to insert such files.

NOTE:	PROBLEMS WITH `CONTROL CHARACTERS' (the disappearing `minus'):
	Some applications cannot handle character strings that contain
	a character with character code zero.  This includes Adobe
	Illustrator and Adobe PDF Reader.  Usually the first symptom of
	this is that `minus' signs in math disappear (Minus is usually 
	character code zero in the math symbol font).  To avoid these
	problems, add `Remap=1' to your `dviwindo.ini' file.

NOTE:	DISAPPEARING LINES --- Stealth video boards:
	At certain resolutions, some of the latest drivers for the Stealth
	video boards do not display one pixel wide lines correctly.  
	This happens in the 640 x 480 32k color and the 600 x 800 256 color
	modes.  Magnify or zooom in to check that division lines in displayed
	math are actually present.   You can try and add the line

		UseRect=1

	in your DVIWINDO.INI file.  This may or may not help. Switch to 
	any other resolution/color depth combination to avoid the problem. 

	These drivers also may loose a one pixel line at the edge when images
	are dragged around on the screen (`Alt' key and left mouse button).
	Refresh the display by double clicking anywhere to get rid of glitches.

NOTE:	DISAPPEARING LINES --- some clone printers:
	Some clone printers drop lines that are only one pixel wide.
	You can work around this problem in most cases by adding

		UseRect=1

	to your DVIWINDO.INI file.  Do *not* add this line to DVIWINDO.INI
	if you printer works correctly without it.

NOTE:	INCORRECT LETTER SIZE AND SPACING --- ATI graphics boards:
	Some of the drivers for the ATI graphics board appear to have a 
	problem	with text at certain resolutions.  Apparently they report the
	wrong information to ATM, with the result that letters are shown
	slightly too large.  Letter spacing will appear to be irregular.
	Try different versions of the drivers to resolve this (or different
	resolutions if necessary).  Useful hint: the latest version of the
	driver is not always the most bug free!

NOTE:	POSSIBLE PROBLEMS WITH FONT MINDER:
	`Font Minder' appears to have some problems, one of which is that
	it may get confused by `incomplete' font `families'.  That is,
	those for which there is not a simple neat set of `regular',
	`bold', `italic', and `bolditalic'. 

NOTE:	UNEXPECTED PAGE EJECTS WHEN PRINTING TO SOME HP PRINTERS:
	There may be problems with the new softfont downloading code for
	driving  HP printers in ATM 2.5.  Some HP LaserJet Series II
        have problems when more than 16 `softfonts' are in use - 
	this may cause a page to be ejected unexpectedly.
	In this case you can ask ATM to switch back to its old, 
	slower behavior (i.e. downloading the whole page as a bitmap). 
	To do this, bring up the `ATM Control Panel' and check 
	`Print ATM fonts as graphics'.

NOTE:	PRINTING IN COURIER AFTER THE FIRST FEW PAGES:
	This usually means you have either exceeded the printers
	virtual memory (VM), or its capacity to handle fonts. See above.

NOTE:	FLOATING POINT ARITHMETIC PROBLEMS IN SOME HP PS PRINTERS:
	Some new HP printers (LaserJet 4M) have bugs in the PS interpreter,
	including problems with floating point arithmetic.  This can cause
	parts of the text to be displaced.  If this is a problem, then 
	please ask HP for the latest ROM upgrade.  One of these bugs has
	been fixed in the latest versions of the printers, but we just
	received reports of a new floating point arithmetic bug...

NOTE:	SOME HP POSTSCRIPT PRINTERS HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ACCENTED CHARACTERS:
	Accents (particulary `acute' and `grave' may disappear when printing
	accented characters on these clone PS printers).

2. General Trouble-Shooting Information
=======================================

NOTE:	MOTTLED PRINTING DUE TO COLORED FONTS:
	If printed output looks `mottled', `gray', `broken up', it may 
	be because you have `Color Fonts' selected.  This color codes
	the fonts on screen.  Some printer drivers use different 
	gray-level to denote different colors, and gray-levels are 
	in turn simulated using half-tone screens.

NOTE:	RULES LOOK OUTLINED RATHER THAN FILLED:
	Make sure that `Fill Rules' in the `Font' menu is checked.

NOTE:	`INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO RUN THIS APPLICATION...'
	You may get this message if you have an old version of DVIWindo
	running when you try to launch the new.  Quit the old one first.

NOTE:	SLOW DISPLAY DUE TO ATM CACHE TOO SMALL:
	Speed of display depends dramatically on the video board.
	However, the size of the ATM cache also has a large effect.
	When first installed, ATM sets the cache much too small to be 
	useful.  Double click on the ATM icon and set the cache to at
	least 256k --- use 512k to 1Meg if you have plenty of RAM.	

NOTE:	SLOW REDISPLAY DUE TO `FAVOUR POSITION'
	Do not check `Favour Position' (unless there is some good reason),
	since it will slow down screen display.
	`Favour Position' may be useful when long strings of mono-
	spaced characters are displayed (to avoid accumulating position
	error) --- although setting StringLimit to a small value is better.
	If you have problems with spacing in mono-space fonts, 
	make sure they are listed in the [Mono] section of ATM.INI.

NOTE:	FONT DISPLAY PROBLEMS DUE TO CONFUSED WIN.INI or ATM.INI
	If you are switching from an earlier version of ATM to ATM 2.5,
	you may experience some problems, since ATM 2.02 did not do a
	good job of maintaining WIN.INI and font metric information.
	If you get `invisible ink' problems, make backup copies of
	ATM.INI and WIN.INI, then `Remove' all fonts using ATM (this
	does not delete any font files).  Exit Windows.  Delete the file
	ATMFONTS.QLC (Important!) in the PFB file directory (usually
	c:\psfonts).  Relaunch Windows.  Double click on the ATM icon, 
	select `Add'. 	Navigate to the directory with the PFM metric files 
	(usually c:\psfonts\pfm) and select all the fonts listed.  

	If this doesn't solve the problem, then exit Windows, edit
	ATM.INI and WIN.INI: remove ALL fonts from the [Fonts] section of
	ATM.INI. Remove ALL `softfontxyz=...' lines from WIN.INI. Delete
	ATMFONTS.QLC, and use ATM to reinstall ALL of the fonts, as above.
	This may sound like a bit of a pain, but dealing with a totally
	confused ATM is even worse.

	MAKE SURE YOU USE ATM 2.6 --- it is much easier to recover from
	such problems with ATM 2.6 than with ATM 2.5 or earlier.

NOTE:	INABILITY TO USE TIMES AND HELVETICA:  
	If you install the `retail' ATM (the one in a box) over a
	previously installed `bundled' ATM (the one in the envelope),
	then you most likely will get the [Aliases] and [Synonyms]
	sections in ATM.INI into a confused state.  This is because
	the `bundled' version uses TimesNewRomanPS and GillSans or Arial
	instead of Times-Roman and Helvetica.  The ATM installation
	program does not correct existing entries in  the [Aliases]
	and [Synonyms] section. Please use the file ATM.CNF on the ATM
	diskette as a guide to correct your ATM.INI manually.
	(Note that the ATM that comes with Acrobat is a `retail' ATM).

NOTE:	OLD BSR CM FONTS WON'T SHOW LIGATURES:
	Some older versions of the BSR CM fonts have a quirk in
	the PFM metric files that prevent DVIWindo from recognizing
	that they should be remapped.  The symptom is that ligatures
	(fi, fl, ff, ffi, ffl) and special characters do not display
	correctly, and/or lead to `invisible ink' in ATM.  Add `Remap=2'
	to your DVIWINDO.INI file to work around this problem.  
	And contact us for up-to-date PFM files for the CM fonts.	

NOTE:	DVIPSONE.EXE SHOULD BE ON PATH FOR PRINTING CALL FROM DVIWINDO:
	If you try to use DVIPSONE for printing from DVIWindo, but get
	`DVIPSONE.EXE file not found' error messages (or find the `Use
	DVIPSONE' check box greyed out), then make sure that DVIPSONE.EXE can
	be found by DVIWindo.  DVIWindo looks in the DOS PATH, the default
	directory for DVIPSONE, in the directory specified by the environment
	variable PREPATH as well as the environment variable VECPATH.

	Ideally you should also have a PIF file set up for DVIPSONE so you
	can control how DVIPSONE appears while it runs.  For example, without
	the PIF file, DVIPSONE may run full screen.

NOTE:	If you can't launch DVIWindo by double clicking on a DVI file
	in the File Manager, then you need to add the line

		DVIWINDO.exe=c:\dviwindo\DVIWINDO.exe

	to the [programs] section of your dviwindo.ini file (add
	a [programs] section at the end if there isn't one already).
	This isn't necessary if the DVIWindo directory is on your PATH.
	(Also, the new installation procedure does this for you).

NOTE:	If DVIWINDO.INI should ever get in a confused state, rename it
	and let DVIWindo build a new one.  You can then copy over the
	[Applications] section --- which contains your TeX Menu
	customizations, the [Environment] section --- which contains
	the environment variables, and any other special settings you might
	have in the [Window] section.

HINT:	LOOSING PREFERENCES -- KEEP FINGERS OFF KEYBOARD!
	If you sometimes loose your DVIWindo preferences, you may be holding
	down the control key while double clicking on the DVIWIndo icon.
	This loads up DVIWindo without reading the preferences.  Everything
	reverts to `factory defaults', including the default page position.
	Also, DVIWindo won't remember what file you last looked at or what 
	font you last displayed.  

	DVIWindo now puts up a dialog box to verify that you really want
	to start without reading the preferences. Click `Cancel' if that
	is not what you intended. Alternatively, exit later from DVIWindo
	while holding down the control key.  This will stop DVIWindo from
	overwriting your preferences stored in 	`dviwindo.ini'.  The next
	time you start, DVIWindo will read in the old settings. 

	By the way, if you have several instances of DVIWindo running,
	only the first will normally write preferences back to `dviwindo.ini'
	This is to avoid confusion and conflict between different settings.

3. SHARE (and simultaneous access to DVI files):
================================================

NOTE:	PLEASE INSTALL SHARE.EXE in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
	DVIWindo has been modified to work correctly with `share.exe'
	installed.  We now recommend that you load `share.exe' in your
	`autoexec.bat' file.  This will prevent complaints from Windows
	when different applications are trying to get at the same DVI file.
	(Note that `Windows for WorkGroups' uses its own module VSHARE). 

	If you do get `sharing violation' messages despite this, then add
	the line `Share=0' to your `dviwindo.ini' file (this should not
	normally be necessary). This will turn off DVIWindo's regular
	sampling of the DVI file.  You may then have to double click 
	on the window after changing a DVI file to get DVIWindo to 
	display the new version.  

	Another way to avoid sharing violations while creating a new 
	version	of a DVI file is to minimize DVIWindo.  Again, this 
	should NOT normally be neccessary, however.

	If you are using a Network, and you get occasional crashes
	when using DVIWindo, or when calling Y&YTeX from DVIWindo, then
	add `Share=0' to the [Window] section of your `dviwindo.ini.'

NOTE:	PLEASE INSTALL SHARE.EXE in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
	If you get `Violation of System Integrity' when calling DVIPSONE 
	from DVIWindo, than you may have a problem with `sharing violations'.
	Use `share.exe' (that is, install it in your `autoexec.bat' file).
	See the above note if this causes `sharing violations'.  Actually,
	such sharing violations should never happen, since DVIWindo does not
	look at the DVI file while DVIPSONE is working on it...

NOTE:	SOME EDITORS KEEP FILES BEING EDITED OPEN:
	Many editors (s.a. Windows NotePad and Lugaru's Epsilon) do not keep
	files open while you edit.  Unfortunately some Windows editors (e.g.
	Windows Write and MicroSoft Word ) keep the file you are editing
	open. 	So you cannot TeX it when SHARE is installed, since TeX will
	get a `sharing violation' error. Close the file before running TeX.

4. Font Related Issues:
========================

NOTE:	FASTER PRINTING TO POSTSCRIPT PRINTERS:
	If you have many fonts installed, then it may be worthwhile getting
	the latest MS Windows PostScript driver (release 3.55 or later) ---
	it is a lot faster at setting up printer device contexts.
	(The main reason is that the new version keeps caches of font 
	metric information for each installed printer in files with 
	extension `.fsf' in the Windows directory). 

	You can download PSCRIP.EXE from various places, including the 
	MS BBS	at (206) 637-9009 or (high speed line) (206) 936-6735.
	Run PSCRIP.EXE after downloading it.  It will expand itself
	into several files, including PSCRIPT.DRV and some text files.

	The new PostScript driver is also included with the MS Windows
	TrueType Font Pack 2 (but not with the original TrueType font pack)
	and with PageMaker 5.0 for Windows.  

	It is also included with Windows 3.11 (Windows for WorkGroups).
	And PSCRIPT.DRV 3.58 is included with the Windows 3.11 upgrade.
	GO MSL on CompuServe, and download the file WW0981.EXE

NOTE:	FRACTION AND MAPSTO DISAPPEAR ON POSTSCRIPT PRINTER:
	There is a bug in the current version of the  Windows 3.1 PostScript
	printer driver relating to characters with zero - or small - advance
	widths, such as the `negation slash' and `mapsto' in CMSY10 and LBMS.
	Such characters will not be printed if they are preceeded and
	followed directly by a font switch. This means that `not equal', `not
	less' and `not greater' may not print correctly, even though they are
	shown correctly on screen. Most other negated relation work OK,
	because they involve other characters drawn from CMSY10.

	If this is a problem, use the modified PFM files on subdirectory
	PSCRIPT on the last diskette of the Computer Modern font set if you
	are using CM fonts, and on the last diskette of the Lucida Bright 
	and Lucida New Math font set if you are using LB + LNM.  
	Contact Y&Y if you cannot find the modified PFM files.

	You normally won't need this fix with the LB + LNM font set,
	however, because negated relations occur as complete glyphs in
	LucidaNewMath-Arrows, rather than having to be constructed out of
	pieces, as in CM. 

	The Adobe PS Printer driver does not have this problem:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Adobe's new printer driver for Windows provides a winning combination
	of optimal application support and printer control. Functions of the
	driver include:

		Printer feature controls
		Calibrated color
		Built in Downloader and Printer Manager
		Pre-download host-resident fonts
		Download of archived PostScript files
		Initialize and configure hard drives attached to printers
		Reset and initialize printers
		Print out lists of printer resident fonts
		Available for $25 by calling 1-800-833-6687

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:	BIZZARE FONT SELECTION IN POSTSCRIPT PRINTER OUTPUT:
	If you get bizarre font selection on PostScript printer output,
	--- particularly if this happens only after the first page ---
	read the end of `atmtwo.txt' for trouble shooting information
	and description of another bug in PSCRIPT.DRV. 

NOTE:	DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN ATM ON SCREEN and PSCRIPT PRINTING:
	There may on rare occasions be difference between on-screen display
	and printed results, since printing to PostScript printers is handled
	by PSCRIPT.DRV, while on-screen display is taken care of by ATM.
	Some trouble-shooting information is provided in `printing.txt'

NOTE:	BAD SPACING AND WRAP AROUND WITH MONOSPACED FONT:
	If you get spacing problems on screen with long strings of characters
	from  fixed width fonts, add them to the [Mono] section of ATM.INI.
	For example:

		[Mono]
		Courier=Yes
		LetterGothic=Yes
		PrestigeElite=Yes
		Orator=Yes
		CMTT10=Yes
		LucidaSansTypewriter=Yes
		LucidaSansLD=Yes

	You may also wish to experiment with StringLimit=4 in 
	dviwindo.ini (the default is now 8).

5. Can't Find Font?
===================

NOTE:	The DVIWindo error message `Can't find font xxxxx' comes in two forms.
	The TeX font name (i.e. the name of the TFM file) is always shown.
	If DVIWindo did not find an entry for a font file of that name
	in ATM.INI (for Type 1 fonts), in WIN.INI (for TrueType fonts)
	or in `dviwindo.fnt,' then it will add `(No Face Name)' to the message.
	If DVIWindo  _did_  find a purported Windows Face Name, but then
	Windows claims there is  _no_  such face, the message will include
	that Windows Face Name also.

	In the first case, the font has not been installed (use ATM control
	panel for Type 1 fonts, and `Fonts' in the Windows control panel
	for TrueType fonts).  There must be an entry in ATM.INI for each
	installed Type 1 font, and there must be an entry in WIN.INI for
	each installed TrueType font.  Check that the fonts show up in the
	font list offered up when you select `Show Fonts' from the `Fonts'
	menu item in DVIWindo.  

	In the second case, the `Windows Face Name' in ATM.INI or WIN.INI
	is incorrect --- that is, it does not correspond to information in
	the listed metric file (.PFM file in the case of Type 1 and
	.FOT file in the case of TrueType).  In this case a font may very
	well show up the `Show Fonts' list, but cannot be used in TeX until
	you figure out its correct Windows Face Name.  See also next note.

	Sometimes Windows refuses to offer up anything but some system font.
	For example, you may get warnings for every font had "Windows offers:
	Small Fonts".   Look in WIN.INI and try commenting out the
	corresponding lines (in this case "Small Fonts (VGA res)=SMALLE.FON"
	and "Small Fonts (8514/a res)=SMALLF.FON" (use a semicolon at the
	start of the line to comment out a line).

NOTE:	CAN'T FIND MISSPELLED TRUETYPE FONT:
	If you find that DVIWindo gives a `Can't find xxxxx' message
	for some installed TrueType font, then check whether the
	capitalization of the name in WIN.INI is correct.  Compare
	against the name found in the corresponding xxxx.fot file 
	c:\windows\system.  

	An example: The font is called `WingDings' in WIN.INI, but the
	`wingding.fot' file claims the name is actually `Wingdings'. 
	Correct	the entry in WIN.INI in this case. (Since *.fot files are 
	mostly binary, the fontname is easy to recognize as one of the few 
	ASCII strings in the file).   This particular problem is the result
	of an error in the Windows 3.1 `setup.inf' file.

	Also, TrueType font pack #1 has the wrong Windows Face Name
	for `Lucida Sans Demibold' (there is a spurious `Roman' tagged on).

NOTE:	DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT WHAT FONTS ARE INSTALLED:
	There may be disagreements between various applications about
	what fonts are `installed'.  The ATM control panel, for example,
	simply lists all entries it finds in ATM.INI --- independent of 
	whether the files exist, or whether they are valid font files!  
	So this is not very useful. 
	
	A better list may be found by bringing up the `Character Map' in
	the `Accessories' Window group.  This shows all fonts known to
	Windows.  This is the same list of fonts shown by any Windows
	application, including DVIWindo.  If the font you are looking for
	does not show up in this list, then reinstall it.  It has either
	been corrupted or ha

	If the font was installed using ATM, and it does not show up in
	font menus (such as DVIWindo's `Show Fonts') then ATM has decided
	there is something wrong with the font files.

	If you do not see  ANY  of the fonts in Adobe Type 1 format in
	the font list, then check that they are not hidden by Windows.
	In the Windows control panel, select `Fonts', then click on
	`TrueType'.  Make sure that `Enable True Type Fonts' is checked,
	and that `Show only True Type Fonts' is NOT checked.

NOTE:	TIMES AND HELVETICA DISAPPEAR IN TAIL RECURSION...
	Sometimes the [Aliases] and [Synonyms] section of ATM.INI can get
	into a confused state, particularly if new versions of ATM get
	installed on top of old ones.  The `alias' information may 
	actually form a recursive loop. It may then help to comment out
	what is there, if some ATM fonts don't show up, or if `Tms Rmn' 
	is listed in the DVIWindo Fonts menu.  You can also try replacing
	what is there in your ATM.INI with the corresponding part of 
	ATM.CFG	on the ATM distribution diskette. 

NOTE:	CAN'T FIND SOME PREFERENCE MENU ITEMS?
	To make space for some new `Preferences' we have had to move some
	items from that menu to the `Fonts' menu.  If you can't find what
	you are looking for under `Preferences' please look under `Fonts'.

6. News/Additions:
==================

(1)	`Ruler': DVIWindo can show horizontal and vertical dimensions in user
	selected units.  To use this feature, hold down the `shift' key,
	click the mouse at the top left corner of an area you wish to measure,
	and move the mouse to the bottom right corner - keeping the button
	pressed all the time.  To shift the top left corner after starting,
	press the right mouse button - keeping the left one depressed.
	(This is similar to the method used to define a zoom rectangle or a
	rectangle to be copied to the clipboard).  Use the `Preferences' 
	menu to select the units of measurement in this `ruler'.

(2)	TPIC \specials supported: In response to popular demand, we have
	added support for the \specials created by the TeX TPIC macros,
	used for constructing simple diagrams containing polygonal lines,
	arcs, dotted and dashed curves, quadratic splines, pie slices and so
	on.  See the file `tpicspec.txt' and `tpictest.tex' for examples.

(3)	DVITPS figure insertion \specials supported (bringing the total to 11!)

(4)	emTeX `linewidth', `moveto', and `lineto' \specials now supported.
	If you are inserting figures created by TeXcad, use emlines2.sty

(5)	DVIWindo runs under both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.
	DVIWindo takes advantage of some features of Windows 95
	when running in Windows 95 (although no noticable performance
	improvement results from this).

(6) 	DVIWindo can be used with TrueType fonts.  Sample TFM files
        for the `standard' TrueType fonts are included with DVIWindo.
	Try the file `truetype.dvi' for demonstration.

(7)	DVIWindo can dump an AFM file for a Windows font.  
        This simplifies use of font rendering software other than ATM, 
	where AFM files (needed to create TFM files) may not be available
        --- as, for example, when using TrueType fonts.
	You may want to do a sanity check on the resulting AFM file,
	since some TrueType fonts give inaccurate metric information
	(In particular, the XHeight is always given as 512, and
	the CapHeight is always the same as the Ascender).

(8)	DVIWindo can `copy' a specified region to the Clipboard.
	This region can then be `pasted' into another application.
	The pasted region acts as a graphical object that can be moved,
	scaled and cropped.  Typeset math using TeX, then import
	into your favorite WYSIWYG application.

(9)	DVIWindo can read compressed TIFF files (not just PackBits).
	(DVIWindo uses Black Ice Software's TIFFREAD DDL).

(10)	DVIWindo supports EPSI previews as well as EPSF format.
	This is convenient for EPS files generated on Unix systems.

(11)	DVIWindo can pass through EPS files when printing to a PS printer.
	(instead of printing the TIFF or EPSI preview in an EPSF file).
        Use a check box in the Preferences menu to control which is used.

(12)	It is possible to invoke DVIPSONE from DVIWindo for printing
	a DVI file. This provides for faster printing, and just about
	eliminates the chance of running out of printer virtual memory (VM)
	(since DVIPSONE uses partial font downloading, while PSCRIPT.DRV
	downloads complete fonts).  

	DVIWindo only shows the DVIPSONE check box in the `Print' Dialog
	if it can locate DVIPSONE.  To control how DVIPSONE runs when
	called from DVIWindo, create a PIF file for DVIPSONE.  Use PIFEdit
	if there isn't one already created by DVIWindo installation.
	Note that entries placed on the command line by PIFEdit are lost,
	DVIWindo needs to be able to pass command line arguments to DVIPSONE.
	If you want to have default command line flags and arguments for 
	DVIPSONE, set up a `DVIPSONE.CMD' file 	(see DVIPSONE manual).

(13)	DVIWindo can be launched and asked to open a particular DVI file
	simply by double clicking on the DVI file in the File Manager.
	The DVIWindo installation procedure makes this possible by 
	associating DVIWindo with files that have extension `.dvi'.
	If DVIWindo is not on the PATH, you may need to add

		DVIWINDO.exe=c:\dviwindo\DVIWINDO.exe

	to the [programs] section of your dviwindo.ini file.

(14)	DVIWindo can also be invoked by the `drag-and-drop' feature.
	Drag the DVI file from File Manager to the DVIWindo window --- or the
	DVIWindo icon of an inactive DVIWindo --- and drop it on the window
	or icon.  DVIWindo will open the file and show the first page.

	To use this feature in Windows 3.0, first copy SHELL.DLL from the
	distribution diskette to your Windows directory.

(15)	It is possible to have the screen mapping reset when
	going to a new page.  Check `Reset Scale New Page' in the
	`Preferences' menu.  Going to the previous page sets the screen 
	mapping	for page bottom when this feature is selected.  
	NOTE: To temporarily invert the effect of the new switch, hold 
	down the control key while selecting `Next!' or `Previous!'.

(16)	It is possible to set the `top of page' screen mapping
	to something other than the default screen mapping.  Select
	`Set New Page Scale' from the `File' menu.  To get the
	default screen mapping click on `Default Scale' first.

(17)	One can select reverse order printing and printing of
	alternate pages using check boxes in the `Print' dialog box. 

(18)	DVIWindo notices when a DVI file changes and displays the new
	version (even when there is no user interaction directly with 
	DVIWindo).  So one can run DVIWindo in one Window, TeX in another,
	and an editor in a third.  When a file is modified and run through
	TeX, the display in the DVIWindo window is automatically updated.

(19)	A small Windows utility called CLEANUP is included that cleans up
	inactive Windows.  This is useful if PIF files for TeX or DVIPSONE
        are set up with `Close Window on Exit' unchecked 
	(see Appendix E of the manual for more details).

(20)	DVIWindo can use a font name remapping file when the DVI file
	calls for fonts using names other than the font file names
	on the system being used to view the DVI file.  There can be a
	generic font name remapping file in the DVIWindo directory 
	(called dviwindo.fnt), as well as DVI-file specific ones in
	the same directory as the DVI file.  These files should
	have the same name as the DVI file, but extension `.fnt'.
	
@	Font name remapping is useful when only the 40 most commonly
	used Computer Modern fonts are installed and the other 35 remapped.  

@	Font name remapping is useful when using font scaling technology
	other than ATM (for Adobe Type 1) or MS Windows (for TrueType).  

@	Font name remapping is useful when ATM comes with fonts
	whose names don't match printer resident fonts (such as
	TimesNewRomanPS instead of Times-Roman and GillSans instead
	of Helvetica).

@	Font name remapping is useful when the DVI file uses names for
	fonts other than the actual font file names used by ATM or TrueType.
	For example, if you like Karl Berry names, then use `dviwindo.fn2'


7. Complete List of Command Line Arguments to DVIWindo:
=======================================================

In `normal' use, DVIWindo needs no command line arguments (and cannot 
be given command line arguments).  However, DVIWindo can be invoked :

	(a) directly, by double clicking on the DVIWindo icon, or 
	(b) by double clicking on a DVI file, or 
	(c) by dragging and droppping a DVI file on an iconized	DVIWindo, or
	(d) from another Windows application using `WinExec', or 
	(e) from a PIF file.  

In the last two situations, one can supply a command line to indicate
what DVIWindo is supposed to do.  DVIWindo can be asked to show a
selected page of a specified document, or to print a selected page
range of one or more DVI files.  Command line flags and arguments are
preceded by `-', as in DVIPSONE.

Any argument that does not start with `-' is considered to be a file name.
File name(s) should come after all command line flags and command line
arguments. 

It is possible to call DVIWindo from another application to show a DVI file.
The following command line argument can be used in this case:

	-p=<n>	 page to show when the specified DVI file is opened.

It is possible to call DVIWindo from another application just 
to print files.  Use the command line argument `w'.  For example:

	-w="Apple LaserWriter II NT",pscript,COM1:

The first argument is the `device', the second the `driver' and the
third the `port' (in the form found in WIN.INI). The device name
must be enclosed in double quotes if it contains spaces.  The default
printer will be used if the device, driver, and port are omitted
(that is, if only `-w' appears on the command line).

When printing, it is also possible to specify a page range using

	-b=<begin>	and 	-e=<end>

Page order can be reverse using `-r' on the command line, and one can
print alternate pages only using `-s' on the command line.

Several files can be printed in one call.  Note that some of the above 
is set up to provide a simple interface with TCI's Scientific Word.
See `sciword.txt' for additional details.

If you have problems with calls to DVIPSONE when printing, AFMtoTFM
when using `WriteTFM...', or when calling arbitrary Windows or DOS
programs from the `TeX Menu' then you may want to try 

	-d

on the command line. This forces DVIWindo to first show the command line
it will use to call these applications.

8. Complete List of Options controlled by entries in `DVIWINDO.INI':
====================================================================

DVIWINDO.INI (in the Windows directory) is where DVIWindo remembers your
preferences between invocations.  You don't normally need to edit this 
file, since the preferences are set from DVIWindo's menus.  Should this
file ever get corrupted, simply delete it and DVIWindo will build a new
one the next time it is launched.

Just for reference here are the items normally found in the [Window] section:

Save		Set to 1 if preferences are to be saved.
Preferences	Long list of boolean preference choices.
Size		Window position and size.
Mapping		Coordinate transformation for chosen screen scale and position
FileName	Name of the last DVI file viewed.
Defaults	DVI File selection defaults.
SourceFileName	Name of the last TeX source file referred to in TeX Menu.
SourceDefaults	Source File selection defaults.
Font		Last font looked at in `Show Fonts'
Encoding	Last encoding used in `WriteAFM...'
Units		Units selected for DVIWIindo measurement box

The above can all be controlled from various menus in DVIWindo.  The
following optional entries cannot, and must be added to the file using an
editor, if needed. 

Remap=0		undo the remapping presently used to get around the multiple 
		encoding bug in ATM 2.5 and earlier.
		You can use this setting if you have ATM 2.6 - which is
		presently only available as part of Adobe Acrobat.

Remap=1		present default (needed for ATM 2.5 and earlier versions)
		(remaps 0 - 31 to 161 - 170 and 173 - 195).
		This is also needed if you use the Acrobat PDF Writer,
		since Acrobat files are not displayed properly if 
		the control character range is used.

Remap=2		force remapping on ALL fonts (not just those that pass
		DVIWindo's test).

Remap=3		use modified rules for deciding when to remap 
		(i.e. override `mis-feature' of some old BSR CM PFM files)

TTRemap=1	Remap 0 -- 31 to 161 -- 195 in all TrueType fonts. 
		Possibly useful when using MicroSoft TrueType Lucida fonts,
		or some low quality Computer Modern font look-alikes made 
		in TrueType format. 

TTOnly=1	Use only TT fonts (mostly just a debugging tool)

Share=0		stops DVIWindo's resampling of the DVI file to note changes -
		use this to avoid `sharing violations' - if that is a problem.
		(But it is better to install SHARE.EXE instead).

Offset=0	use default `Top Of Page' instead of position set by	
		`Set New Page Scale' (i.e. revert to old behavior).

ShowName=0	suppress placement of file name when inserted EPS file
		does not have a preview - useful if `EPS' file has a large
		bounding box covering the whole page (as for crop marks)

Screen=1	Use special elliptical screen for half-tones - better than
		built-in screen on laser printers - *but* do not use for image
		setters, which _do_ have well designed built-in screens.

Frequency=53	Control screen frequency in half-tones (see `Screen=1')

Angle=45	Control angle of screen in half-tones (see `Screen=1')

BGR=1		flip from BGR to RGB order in 24 bit color TIFFs to
		compensate for byte order error in some old TIFF files.

UseRect=1	use alternate rectangle filling mode - possibly useful on 
		some buggy display drivers that do not show one-pixel lines.
		Also useful on some clone PS interpreters that show rules
		as outlines instead of filled.

StringLimit=1	limits the number of characters drawn on screen at one time. 
		may be useful for dealing with numeric overflow in Windows
		and ATM when using large point sizes and viewing at large
		magnifications - particularly when using fixed width fonts.
		(Present default is 8).  See also `Favor Position' and
		[Mono] section of ATM.INI.

Escape=0	Suppress program exit when `Escape' is hit.

Alternate=1	Use the old alternate page printing scheme (backward
		compatability, and perhaps for linkage from Scientific Word)

Aspect=0	Do not constrain zoom rectangle aspect ratio to match screen

BorderColor=<r> <g> <b>	Color of paper size border lines

LinerColor=<r> <g> <b>	Color of text area lines

FigureColor=<r> <g> <b>	Color of box for EPS figure without preview

		The above control of colors may be useful on a monochrome
		display were lines in lighter colors are mapped to white.

MapBase=<mag>	set base magnification, default 1000.  Possibly useful when
		finite size magnification steps to not provide good match
		with screen size on low resolution displays.  Try 950 or 1050. 

SmallStep=1	Make magnification increments 10% instead of 20%

HyperText=0	Turn off hyper text linkage (botton to mark).

IgnoreBadEncoding=1	Suppresses the `... use \input ansiacce' message,
			even if you are using characters in the 0 - 31 range
			in an ANSI encoded font (which is inconsistent).

CommDlg=0	Do not use the Windows 3.1 common dialog procedure for
	        opening files. Not recommended.

CommFind=0	Do not use Windows common dialog box for `Search'

WorkingDirectory=...	Where you want TeX to deposit DVI files when called
			from TeX Menu.  Omit, or set to `nul' to have TeX
			work in the directory of the source file instead.

PreviewHotKey=F1	Allows you to set the `hot key' for the `Preview'
			item in the TeX Menu.  The default is C-F1.

Deslash=1	Convert \ to / in file names before calling applications 
		from TeX menu.  Needed for some TeX implementations that
		treat \ in file names as TeX control sequences.

CmdShw=...	Control mode in which DOS box window is shown in WinExec.

MaxBright=...	Value between 0 and 255 (default 183).  Colors brighter than
		this will not be considered for `Color Fonts'.  

PaletteOffset=	Value between 0 and 255. Shift color table in `Color Fonts'

ColorStable=1	Use TeX internal font numbers in `Color Font' palette
		(Makes colors stable between jobs using same format file).

FontMap=0	Do not search for aliases in `texfonts.map' when a font
		cannot be found.

SciWord=1	Interpret EPS figure inclusion \specials from Scientific Word

DVIPSONE=...	Command line flags and arguments to be passed to DVIPSONE.

UseDVIPSONE=	Printer ports on which DVIPSONE should be used for printing
		(use semicolons to separate multiple ports e.g. FILE:;LPT1:).
		Can be overridden temporarily by check box in `Print' dialog.

The DVIWINDO.INI file also has an [Applications] section which supports
the `TeX Menu'.  Details of this section may be found in `texmenu.txt'.

The DVIWINDO.INI file can also have an [Environment] section which overrides
DOS environment variables for DVIWindo, DVIPSONE, and Y&YTeX.  To disable this
feature, make sure to set the environment variable USEDVIWINDOINI to zero:

	SET USEDVIWINDOINI=0

*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** 

9. Uninstalling DVIWIndo:
=========================

Should you wish to remove DVIWindo from your computer (we can't imagine why
:=), simply delete all the files in the DVIWindo directory.  In DOS 6.0 you
can do this using just one command: 

	deltree /Y c:\dviwindo

You may also want to delete the file DVIWINDO.INI from the Windows directory,
and delete the icons and the program group in Windows ProgMan.
