DVIPSONE, release 0.6 (1990 October 1).  (Thus outdated, but maybe
useful as a starting point.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE: 		dvipsone <file-name> <enter>
-----

will run DVIPSONE on <file-name>.DVI and write the output into the
file <file-name>.PS Similarly,

		dvipsone -d=PRN <file-name> <enter>

will run DVIPSONE on <file-name>.DVI and send the output directly to
the printer (the argument following the flag `d' can also be LPT1,
LPT2, LPT3, COM1, COM2, NUL, or a file name). 

To see the available command line flags and arguments, invoke the
program without arguments: 

	C:\DVIPSONE\DVIPSONE <enter>

To see short explanations of the command line flags and arguments,
invoke DVIPSONE with a '?' command line flag:

	C:\DVIPSONE\DVIPSONE -? <enter>

You can, for example, tell DVIPSONE that your font files are in other
than the default directory, send output to a file instead of the
printer, use font substitution or font remapping, or request more
verbose output.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUXILIARY FILES:
---------------

Font Metric Information:

DVIPSONE normally does not require additional font metric
information.  When fonts are substituted for, however, DVIPSONE needs
to refer to the metric files of the font being substituted for.  
DVIPSONE can get font metric information from three types of files:
AFM, TFM and PFM.

If TeX TFM files are available, communicate their location to
DVIPSONE either using a command line argument (-t), or by setting the
environment variable TFMPATH to the directory containing these files
(default c:\pctex\textfms;c:\tex\fonts).  

If TeX TFM files are not available, but Adobe font Metric (AFM) files
are, tell DVIPSONE where to find the AFM files, either using a
command line argument (-a), or by setting the environment variable
AFMPATH to the directory containing these files 
(default c:\psfonts\afm;c:\tex\afm).  

The final alternative is to use PFM (printer font metric) files.  
To use these, tell DVIPSONE where to find them, using a command line
argument (-p) or set the environment variable PFMPATH to the
directory containing these files (default c:\psfonts\pfm).

Outline Fonts:

The location of the outline font files can be communicated to
DVIPSONE either through command line argument (-f) or by setting the
environment variable PSFONTS (default c:\cm;c:\psfonts). 

EPS files:

Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files to be inserted using \special's
are searched for in a directory that can be specified either in the
command line (-i) or by setting the environment variable PSPATH.

Font Substitution:

If the set of fonts available does not include some that are needed
for the document being processed, a file may be used to tell DVIPSONE
what fonts to substituted for the missing ones.  The location of the
font substitution file may be communicated to the program using a
command line argument (-s).  

The format of the font substitution file is simple:  each non-comment
line contains a 'from' file name separated from a 'to' file name by
some white space.  Any line starting with '%' is a comment.  Files
that need not be downloaded because they are resident in the printer
are marked by placing *reside* after the 'to' field which contains
the full PostScript fontname used in the printer.

Fonts that are to be substituted for even when the font files are
present must be flagged by placing *force* after the 'to' field,
which contains the name of the font to be used as a replacement.

Fonts that need to be remapped to the standard TeX text character
encoding are indicated by *remap* after the 'to' field which
contains the name of the font to be used as a base for remapping.
The character encoding to be used is indicated in field following *remap*.
The default is TeX text (as used for roman, bold and sans serif fonts).

Sometimes a different name is used for a font in the DVI file than
the name it is known under on the system running DVIPSONE.  In this
case use *alias* in the third field.

For sample files, see STANDARD.SUB and RESIDENT.SUB and others with
extension .SUB.  For sampe files for character remapping, see the
files TEXTEXT.VEC and others with extension .VEC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

MODEX.COM and Baud Rates:
-------------------------

The program MODEX.COM is included to facility setting the baud rates
on serial communication ports COM1: and COM2: to something higher
than 19,200 baud (DOS and Windows restriction).  MODEX takes arguments in
essentially the same way that the DOS command MODE does.  

Without arguments MODEX display the present settings of COM1: and COM2:.

Reasonable values for baud rate are 38400 and 57600. To make sure the
operating system does the right thing when the printer becomes busy
and refuses further output from the computer, use the DOS command
"MODE COM1: 19200,n,8,1,b" before using MODEX (MODEX does not
interpret the trailing b parameter).

NOTE: Remember to change the baud rate on the printer side before you
change it on the computer side.  

NOTE: some DOS and Windows applications cannot deal with baud rates
above 19,200 - so remember to lower the rate again before invoking
these programs.

NOTE: use of a print spooler is highly recommended.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

EHANDLER - Debugging Information from PostScript output:
-------------------------------------------------------

The output from DVIPSONE should normally not cause any error
condition in the PostScript interpreter in the printer.  It is
possible that something may go wrong, however, either because a
PostScript `clone' does not obey the rules exactly, or because an EPS
file inserted using \special misbehaves.

When the PostScript file sent to the printer contains some error,
typically nothing is printed.  To get some information about what is
wrong, first download the file EHANDLER.PS (an Adobe utility
program), for example, by typing

	copy c:\dvipsone\ehandler.ps lpt1:/b CR

The state of the PostScript interpreter is then shown on a printed
page when the next error occurs.  The downloaded error handler remains
resident until the printer is power cycled or rebooted.
