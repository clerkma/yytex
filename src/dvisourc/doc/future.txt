	%%IncludeResource: font ...   (and %%IncludeFont: ...):
---------------------------------------------------------------------

DVIPSONE 1.1 will insert fonts where called for in EPS files by the
`%%Include...'  DSC (Document Structuring Conventions) comments (both the
current DSC 3.0 and the older DSC 2.0 version).  DVIPSONE will expand PFB
font files to PFA format as required (and just copy PFA format files `as is')
if it can find them (DVIPSONE complains if it can't find the fonts).

DVIPSONE will list the font file names as it processes them.  
So you should see (in verbose mode) the name of the inserted 
EPS file followed by the names of the font files that it calls for.

DVIPSONE needs to translate from PostScript FontName (which is what
is given in the %%Include comment) to DOS font file name (needed to
find the PFB file to unpack).  It is best to set up a file called
`ATMFONTS.MAP' (but see potential short-cut below) and place it in
the same directory as the PFB files (actually any directory in the
semi-colon separated list of directories specified by the environment
variable PSFONTS).  The file `ATMFONTS.MAP' should contain lines of
the form

	<PostScript FontName>=<PFB file name>

e.g.	LucidaCalligraphic-Italic=lbc

Lines starting with `%' or `;' are treated as comments. Note that the
font file name need not be fully qualified if the corresponding PFB
(or PFA) file is in a directory in the list of directories specified
by the environment variable PSFONTS.

If you use Adobe Type Manager (ATM), then you may be able to avoid
the need to set up an ATMFONTS.MAP file. If DVIPSONE cannot find
ATMFONTS.MAP, then it tries to find the Windows directory and
ATM.INI in order to translate from PostScript FontName to DOS font
file name.  This is not always completely reliable, because ATM.INI
lists Windows Face Names with styles, rather than PostScript
FontNames.  So instead of `Times-Bold', you will see `Times,BOLD' and
instead of `Helvetica-Oblique' you will see `Helvetica,ITALIC'.  
Most of the time DVIPSONE will find the correct file despite this.  
You can verify that it is picking up the right files by using verbose
mode (-v) and noting what font files are listed after each included EPS file.
If DVIPSONE makes an error, then you can add a line for that particular
font to ATMFONTS.MAP and let it resort to ATM.INI for the rest.
If it is critical then please set up a complete ATMFONTS.MAP file.

Note that, as recommended by Adobe, the font is inserted where it is
called for, and is inserted again later (possible in another
save/restore context) when another EPS file calls for it.  No attempt
is made to separate out all fonts called for and load them ahead of
time.  This avoids any problems where the EPS file calls for a font
that the main document also uses (but which may have been modified
by partial font downloading and reencoding).

Also, since DVIPSONE does not include a PostScript interpreter, it
cannot tell which characters are used from the inserted fonts. So
no attempt is made to use `partial font downloading' on such fonts.
Which means files calling for lots of fonts may get quite large.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
	CHECKING FOR PRESENCE OF FONTS ON PRINTER:  
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Normally DVIPSONE downloads all fonts called for --- and complains if
it cannot find a font.  Such a font check is not possible if DVIPSONE
is told that a font is printer resident (either in a font
substitution file or using the `-k' command line flag).  If the font
does not exist on the output device, then the PS interpreter
typically quietly substitutes Courier --- *without* any error indication.  

Using the `-4' command line flag activates code that will print a
page with a list of `missing' fonts if any of the fonts cannot be
found.  The code for doing this tries to take into account the fact
that font retrieval is quite different on an image setter with a hard
drive than it is on a laser printer, but it is *not* guaranteed to work
with all devices, exactly because this aspect of PS interpretation is
somewhat device dependent.



--------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple user supplied header files specified on command line:
--------------------------------------------------------------

The -w=... command line argument can now be used more than once to
include more than one user supplied PostScript header file.


--------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple user supplied header files specified using \special:
-------------------------------------------------------------

The \special{header=...} construct can now be used more than once to
include more than one user supplied PostScript header file.  
In addition, the argument within *one* such special may be a comma
separated list of header files.


--------------------------------
Verbatim PostScript for header:
--------------------------------

The construct

\special{headertext=....}

inserts the specified text into the prolog, after all header files
specified on the command line using '-w' and after all header files
included using \special{header=...}  This \special may occur anywhere
in the DVI file, and may be repeated.  Several chunks of verbatim
PostScript code can be inserted this way.
